title,rating,review
Not as sweet as anticipated which was a good thing.,5.0,The visual representation is absolutely stunning. The freshness of the cookie and delicious chocolate toppings were just over the top. Will surely remember them for future gifts.
Great Taste,5.0,Great taste and very fresh.
"Terrible item, don’t waste your money",5.0,Had a slight problem with the initial order but the seller was very responsive and fixed it. Cookies were fresh and delicious!!!
Great customer service,5.0,The product came in melted and damaged from delivery I assume. The company went above and beyond to fix the issue and make sure we came out happy customers. Great for teacher gifts for holidays and any other occasions.
Awesome buy,5.0,"Great price, and also great taste"
Came in quick,4.0," Came in fast! Impressed with the flavor, only issue is that one of the Biscotti's is a lot smaller than the rest. Overall satisfied with the product."
"Excellent customer service, immediate response !",3.0,The size of item is very deceiving even though it states 5 in box. It is not worth $14.99. Extremely happy with company customer service. Immediate response & happy with outcome.
All was smashed in pieces,4.0,The small crushed pieces tasted good
n/a,5.0,"Like the packaging look nice,"
Perfect Gift,5.0,I was looking for a little something to send for an out of town birthday and the biscotti received rave reviews. Thank you so much. I’ll be ordering again!
"small. average flavor, not impressive for price",3.0,glad i bought sampler before ordering the bigger box as gift
Edible Birthday Gift,5.0,My friend enjoyed her birthday gift!
Great idea,5.0,So easy to send and meant a lot to the receiver
Great For Those Who Love Coffee.,4.0,Definitely great for biscotti fans and coffee lovers alike. Flavors were very well balanced and thought out. Would buy again.
"Tasty, interesting barcode",5.0,"Tasty sweet. A little melty, even on a 74F day. Mine arrived decently crisp, would buy again.

Amazon barcode/label is printed on the box so it's under the shrink wrap .... if gifting this box, be aware ""Barnette's gourmet chocolate [...] birthday get well idea"" is printed on the box; more sensitive recipients may be miffed."
"Very stale, no flavor at all. Will not buy these again.",3.0,"People who sell food through the mail need to follow state and federal food shipping rules including proper packaging...this very small box of very stale biscotti arrived simply in a padded envelope, no provision for heat or safety. The cookies were bland, tasteless."
Box was a lot smaller Than what I anticipated,4.0,It’s a gift for my mom for Mother’s Day. Hopefully she will like it but the box is kind of small versus how it looked in the photo I guess I should read more about it -seems kind a little for the price.
Oh my God way too small for the price,5.0,"They were gift but too small taste good
I won’t reorder them too expensive"
Such a hit! Loved by all!,5.0,Top shelf!
Very tiny package,3.0,"The biscotti were delicious, but I was very surprised at how small the portion was."
Not worth the money,4.0,This was sent as a gift to my daughter. Her comment was that it tasted ok but if you paid a lot for it I would not buy it again. There is only 5 pieces of biscotti in a box so for the price it is not worth it. Disappointed.
Surprise your coffee and chocolate lover,5.0,"This was the best surprise of a mother's day gift. The mom is a coffee and chocolate lover and the novelty of these biscotti elicited a big smile and an ""ooo!"" She made coffee right away to have one.

Just a great idea and she enjoyed every one of them."
They loved them ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,5.0,They loved them !!!
Good but not crunchy,3.0,"These were tasty but lacked that traditional biscotti crunch and were soft instead, almost as of they were old or stale. Otherwise would've been five stars."
I am in love with these cookie treats!,5.0,Wow! These cookies are delicious! The texture is perfect for anyone and everyone including people with trouble chewing. Each flaky bite melts into a smooth and creamy treat!
Smaller than I expected,4.0,"Good but, smaller than I expected. They need more depth ..more biscotti. More density? More real rich chocolate !! More goodness."
Delivery on time.,5.0,I use Fevertree Tonic Water to reduce my muscle cramp problem. It works for me.
Small,2.0,"Much smaller than picture looks, can't even return it, waste of 15.00"
Great tasting Biscotti,5.0,Initially Amazon sent me the Oreo cookies by mistake whereas I had ordered Biscotti. Was able to contact the seller who promptly offered to send me my original order of Biscotti. Not only are the Biscotti very tasty but I highly appreciated the promptness with which the seller corrected Amazon's mistake. Sellers who make their customers a priority are worth re-ordering from. Will definitely be using them again! Thanks for the awesome treats.
So…,3.0,"It does NOT look like the picture at all, it’s basically just a covered Oreo, but it smells good. I can’t eat it thought because I got this as a gift and that would be rude, but the person I gifted it to said it tasted good."
Absolutely delicious,5.0,It came wrapped beautifully and taste so good and fresh. Ten thumbs up.
Biscotti,3.0,overpriced
Fresh and flavorable,5.0,This was a gift and recipient loved them do much they are planning to order another box.
Excellent,5.0,Yummy
Quantity,2.0,Over priced for the amount of cookies
Ok,3.0,"Not in love, but not bad. Nice gift."
TERRIBLE ON ALL LEVELS,1.0,I give this product 0 stars BUT that was not an option so I was forced to give 1 star which it doesn't even deserve. I ordered one 5 CT for myself and a larger one for my inlaws. This was a total disappointment and I'm extremely embarrassed that I sent this as a gift. They looked so delicious and say they are made fresh and shipped the next day....I CALL BS! They are stale DEFINITELY NOT FRESH. Poorly made and the total opposite of gourmet. Looks and taste like cheep CRAP. I would NOT recommend this to anyone. Total fail and waste of $45.
Great gift,5.0,Great gift...recipient very pleased.
Es demasiada pequeña,3.0,Pensé q era mas grande como en la foto muy pequeña
not really biscotti me thinks :0,3.0,"Packaged pretty ..... but even though I bought a package of these for myself I had already sent a few out for holiday gifts ...... I kinda wish I had sent something else.
They just dont have a lot of flavor !!! Also I cant really consider these Biscotti , more like a softer cookie, and considering they were $ 14.99 I expected at least REAL biscotti !!!
Oh well, live and learn :0"
Really really bad purchase,1.0,"I feel dumb. Saw their company review of 4 of 5 stars. I bought 45, yeah FORTY-FIVE to pass out with holiday cards. I opened one up to taste and see. Not really like the picture.

They were broken, and the biscotti was like a wet sponge, tasteless.

NOT RETURNABLE, and I rarely return things, I would return this immediately if I could.

If Barnett's is reading this, is there anything I can do about this big box? I can't give these out.

Anyone want 44 boxes of these things?"
a little disappointed,3.0,The product seemed more like a cookie than a biscotti … I prefer a harder biscotti that will not crumble into the hot coffee.
Not really a biscotti.,3.0,"These are not true biscotti. They are a very delicate cookie with almost more chocolate on top than cookie. The chocolate had a waxy texture. They taste okay. If are expecting a crunchy cookie that you can dip in your coffee, these are not for you."
Crumbled when opened.,3.0,I was looking forward to a treat at the end of the year and ordered these. Everything looked good but the taste and texture were disappointing. Not the robust biscotti offered at coffee shops. More like dense cake that had hardened and been spread on top with chocolate.
"Taste great, fresh; quick shipping!",5.0,"Great overall experience with this purchase!! I gifted this to my mom for Mother’s Day. I placed my order Saturday with free one day shipping, and the cookies arrived to her house Sunday for Mother’s Day...right on time!! Very impressed with the quick shipping. They were packaged nicely, sealed fresh.

Now, the most important part, the taste. Although I did not try the cookies myself, my mom loved them and said they were “wafer-ish and had delicious different chocolate toppings”. She saved a few to dip into her coffee there next day.

Would buy again for future gifts!"
"Ok, but",3.0,I bought a small sample before gifting these. I thought the flavors were not unique. Found them more cake-like and would not survive a good beverage dunk. I recommend trying a small batch to see if you like them before buying a larger box.
not good fr,2.0,"cute idea, maybe i didn't do fast enough shipping but the only enjoyable one was cookies and creme."
Nice,3.0,"Nice, but not great. Much smaller than expected."
Great gift,5.0,This was a gift for some friends and they really liked it and said they were delicious. So it's a nice gift for people in the office or friends. It came with a pretty bow.
Thinking of you Gift,3.0,"Small in size.
Gift was apprecitaed.
Mission Accomplished."
Very small,3.0,It was not what I expected. The box was very small. Just a little larger than my hand. The biscotti tasted more like cookies. The only thing biscotti about them was the shape. Disappointed. I won’t buy again.
Good flavor but agree - NOT biscotti,3.0,These are definitely sweet but we ordered the small box and honestly the only one that had any distinct flavor was the one with peppermint crumbles on top. The rest tasted exactly the same. Really good but the same. And they aren’t even close to biscotti. I’d say more like shortbread or soft cookies. I wouldn’t gift to someone who knows biscotti but it’s a pretty box with tasty cookies for someone you don’t know well. Pretty corporate in other words.
ok,4.0,good
Mild flavor!,3.0,"These are beautifully decorated but the biscotti has very little flavor. I'm glad I purchased the small box first. Biscotti lovers may enjoy them, but I prefer scones."
Nice Birthday Gift,5.0,"Well packaged, looks very nice and taste delicious. Nice gift for someone who likes Biscotti ."
Package came ripped and one came without the bow,1.0,"I ordered six packages to gift to people, one came with the wrapping paper open that is meant to protect the cookies. Another came without the bow that the others had. Very disappointed, now I can’t gift 2 out of the 6, I feel like I wasted my money."
Great gift idea.,5.0,This was a gift for a friend and she loved it.
Save your money!,1.0,"Bought this as a gift but not only was every biscotti broken, the chocolate looked old. The biscotti are nothing at all like they look in the pictures which are deceptive. They are much smaller and frankly don’t look safe to eat. I threw them away."
Pretty Good!,5.0,We are always skeptical about food on Amazon but this was good!
Very good and not enough!,5.0,👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Second time was perfection!,5.0,"The box arrived with a pretty little bow and each biscotti was broken in many pieces. Also, they were crunchy rather “mushy” as in stale. Don’t recommend!
REVISED REVIEW
After I posted my first review, I was contacted by the company with an offer to send me a new box of biscotti for no charge. It arrived yesterday in a well wrapped package with an ice pack to prevent any chocolate from melting.
They were perfect and quite tasty. Kudos to this company for addressing a complaint and “making it right”. Greatly appreciate such great customer service. Mary"
Great thank you/housewarming gift!,5.0,"Gifted these as thank yous for a few college mentors I have, as part of housewarming gifts with wine. I got so many compliments and every person later said they really enjoyed these. I bought one for myself as well, because, why not lol! And they were DELICIOUS! I had mine with my homemade chocolate matcha cappuccino and felt fancy with a face mask for a self treat day. I love that they're really crunchy so you have to slow down to enjoy them. Awesome quality! I have it saved as my go to for gifts... I'm in college and it's so hard to think of what to gift my professors... Until now!"
He absolutely loved them :),5.0,"They was bomb, definitely a good gift to get for people."
The recipient thought it was delicious,4.0,I would have given a five star but it was a gift for a relative and even though they said it was delicious since I did not personally taste it I am giving a 4 star review.
Ummm Yum!,5.0,"So my daughter ordered these for her dad, who granted isnt a sweets kinda guy so he never ate them. But the company sent me a message asking for a review- and I hadnt eaten them because it wasnt my gift. I asked my husband what he thought and he was honest and said he hadnt eaten any of them. So the kids and I cut them up in evenish portions to sample and....holy....tamoly! These things are good! No they are great! The oreo looking one is freaking amazing. If I knew they were going to be as good as they were I would of hidden them and ate them without the kids."
Great gift.,4.0,Great gift.
Great gift,5.0,Purchased for a gift and she loved it
Ummm so yummy,5.0,Normally store brought biscotti is dry but this was so good. Perfect gift for family and friends
Not what I expected.,3.0,A little disappointed with the size for the price I paid. For 15.99 I thought it would have been a little larger.
"Tastes great, easily giftable, but very expensive for what you get",4.0,"These were honestly delicious, I actually bought them for myself for a cheat day off of my diet, but the way they came, then can be easily gifted to someone right when you get them, it’s a nice box/layout. The only downside, it’s pretty expensive for what you get. I’m a chef with a lot of baking experience and for the price of these, could have made dozens of these over. If they were say, half the price, it would be more than worth it."
They were okk,3.0,Yes they were
Horrible product can't rerun i know why!,1.0,the box came with melted cookies.. taste was bad not fresh .. the cookies fell apart... NOT HAPPY plus i can't retrun them it was a gift ... can't gift it and won't eat it .. bought two to make sure it was good ... wasted money no refund ...sad
Wow,5.0,my grandfather ate it all in one day
Tasty,3.0,Very tasty treats with coffee and tea.
Dried out and overpriced for the quality,3.0,Nothing all that special. Very dried out. The packaging was fancy.
Wonderful gift item,5.0,Recipient pleased with packaging presentation and variety of flavors.
A gift for a friend,5.0,I sent this to a friend to cheer her up and she was delighted. Not knowing who they were from made it more exciting for her. She said they were delicious.
Perfect gift,5.0,Purchased 3 as gifts. Each recipient loved them and said how tasty they were. Very little damage to the biscotti on delivery. Would recommend
nice gift cost overpriced....,5.0,"over all a good product, delivery was late although there was an expedite shipping charge be aware ..."
Pretty and yummy! Good gift,4.0,"These are super adorable! The packaging makes it look like a high quality gift, which I can vouch for. These little delectable cookies are great for someone who likes something sweet but not sweet enough to hurt your teeth. All the toppings are delicious!!"
Receiver loved them.,5.0,Shipped to my sister and brother in law. They loved them.
Worth the cost,5.0,Very good.
Nice thank you present.,5.0,Very fresh.
delicious,5.0,very delicious.
Good treat for coffee lovers,3.0,"Shipping was rough on them and the couple of opened boxes had more crumbs. I am sure they get tossed around in the Amazon box. For the price, the box in a padded envelope would have helped that. They were gifts, two ate it politely and one said they were good."
TASTE JUST DELICIOUS,5.0,I LIKE THE PACKAGES THE BOX THAT DISPLAYS MANY DIFFERENTS CHOICE A REAL BISCOTTI RICH IN CHOCOLATE TASTE
perfect gift !’,5.0,fabulous gift !!!
Not much for quality/quinity for the money.,3.0,Freshness wasn't good.
Cookies,1.0,"These were so small. Dry, tasted old…been laying around in storage for a while.
Couldn’t give these as a gift,embarrassed.
Expensive for what arrived."
Fabulous!,5.0,Sent these to my Mom for Valentine’s Day. She said they were delicious!
Nice but TINY! Like a trial sized gift...,3.0,"Nice gift box, looked great, and our Moms said they were yummy, but it was ridiculously small for a gift and the price... like a trial size for a real gift. I definitely should have looked at the dimensions before purchase."
This biscotti was not fresh . It was tasteless . I will not order again,1.0,This biscotti wasn’t fresh! It was tasteless and didn’t even look good . I will not be ordering again.
Look pretty,2.0,These biscuits seemed a little bit soft and underbaked. They looked beautiful but was a little disappointed.
Tasty,4.0,It is very tasty but not fresh. They have different flavor and they are yummy. Overall it is good!
Stale,1.0,Delivery was on time as usual! The packaging was lovely. Unfortunately the cookies tasted stale. I took a bite of a couple thinking it was a fluke but they were stale! Sad. I bought it as a trial as I planned on ordering them as Christmas gifts….but this is not a product I will purchase😔
Good quality,5.0,These were good. Probably the best biscottis I ever had. Much better than what you can get at the store. A couple were broken but not terribly and since it wasn’t a gift it didn’t matter. The taste made up for it anyway. I ate them all at once and that wasn’t my intention.
Good customer service,1.0,I recently had a issue with my purchase … customer service took care of it immediately. It is nice to see good customer service
Great,5.0,Gave as a gift and recipient enjoyed!
Terrible,2.0,The box is very small. Half are broken and not very fresh.
My expectations were high for product and I was very disappointed. Will not buy again!,1.0,Product was a total disappointment. Small and flavor was like a regular cookie.
Perfect gift,5.0,We love them and have gave them as gifts as well!
Good xmas gift for grandfather,5.0,"Bought this as a gift for my grandfather for xmas. Hes so hard to buy for.... he has and buys what he wants soo.... I know he likes biscotti. The box was shut with plastic so I couldn't open it beforehand to look st the cookies , so I was nervous. He opened them and all the cookies were whole. None broken. They looked pretty and came in a pretty box. He likes them!"
Kind of small,4.0,It was ok
Mother's Day Treats!,5.0,I bought these as a gift for my mother and she absolutely loved it! The packaging was is wonderful and the Biscotti's were delicious. My mother enjoyed them quite a lot and couldn't stop gushing about how soft they were!
Recipients were pleased,5.0,Gifts…. Sent to family members
Great Company to use.,4.0,Great Company to use.
Yummy!!,5.0,Pretty and yummy too!!
Freshness and favor.,5.0,Gift
This may be the worst product I have ever bought on Amazon,1.0,"While these biscotti appear attractive, the taste is appalling. They are stale and inedible. Great gift for your enemies."
Dads birthday,5.0,Enjoyed
Not worth the price,3.0,It did not taste that great it was crumbly and it was also melted when I received it
Delicious,5.0,"Purchased as a gift. Recipient highly satisfied, said they're delicious."
Gift,4.0,I bought as a gift so I didn’t get to try them. I was told they looked nice in the package and they were very good. Good value for the price.
Lost,4.0,Don’t know I didn’t eat them
Dissapointing,1.0,These biscotti were extremely disappointing. Seems like they were made a long time ago and are not fresh at all. I do not usually write reviews but felt like this was extremely necessary to write. These did not taste good probably because they were not fresh. Will not buy it again and would not recommend it. I bought them to try first before sending it to someone else as a present but will not be doing that anymore. I would give 0 stars if I could.
Great Gift,5.0,I sent these to some family members with a bag of coffee. It was a wonderful surprise for them. They said they were so good.
Delicious yet Pricey,3.0,"Delicious, but 5 biscottis are not worth $15. I bought 3 boxes as gifts but no one would have believed me I had spent $15 on their present, so I had to invest in new gifts. That’s how I got to try them! I learned not to be guided by ratings and to look at the weight prior to making a decision to purchase any food online."
Fresh and Fun thank you gift,5.0,"Wonderful thank you gift 🎁
My mom was so surprised that they were so fresh and the different flavors
I will use them for my go to thank you gift from now on"
Blech sugar cookie -not biscotti!!!!,1.0,So these are cookies. They are not biscotti. And as cookies they are pretty bad. Basically just icky sweet tasting with no flavors that stand out. They are super soft and crumbley (don't know how anyone would be able to dunk them). They remind me of the super cute cookies at the supermarket bakery that taste aweful!! I wanted to return them but you can't so if you are looking for cookies....go elsewhere. If you are looking for biscotti....go elsewhere! Three of the 5 were also shattered when they arrived. I feel a bit insulted that there are so many good reviews for this product? Wonder if this review will make the review section?
Not what I expected,2.0,The biscotti‘s that I received tasted good but were much smaller than I expected. They are smaller than the standard size biscotti‘s and several of the biscotti’s were crumbled. Not a good experience and not worth the price I paid. I’m glad I got the small box
Gift,5.0,Bought this for a friend and they loved it.
I sent these as a gift. My grandma said they were hard as rocks and not good at all.,1.0,I sent these as a gift. My grandmother said they were hard as rocks and not good at all😫
Just as expected,5.0,"Just as expected... I didn't eat any as it wasn't for me. It might have been horrible, but I wouldn't know. Haven't heard any complaints, though."
Gone,5.0,Good
Yummy,5.0,I love Biscotti. From the plain to the ultra-fancy. This box is a good size. Not too many for the waistline but enough to keep you happy. The price is good so I bought several as gifts for friends who have never tried them. I know a few of them have thoroughly enjoyed them and will be buying more in the future.
Small Quantity,1.0,"Smallest box of candy I’ve ever seen! Gift so I don’t know about taste; however, very little quantity for $15. Hope it tasted good."
Nice presentation and delicious flavor,5.0,Bought this for my husband who has everything plus a sweet tooth. He was surprised and delighted with the variety of flavors. It was the perfect gift for Valentine's Day!
Not what I hoped for,3.0,"Well, I thought they would be kinda like brownies in the middle. Turns out to be more like thick crackers..."
Perfect between class snack for a college kid.,5.0,These were sent as part of a college care package suprise. She loved them. Delicious!!!
Price does not justify the quality,1.0,"It is not worth it. Way too expensive.
And the taste is not as good compare to what I have tasted.
I'm glad I ordered the smallest package to try out."
Good .,3.0,The product is good. Just wanted to try before sending it as a gift.
Beautiful,5.0,"I bought these for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved them! Needless to say, I can’t opinion on the taste bc he pigged out on them lol. Great biscotti! Will buy again!"
"Disappointed , would give zero if possible",1.0,"The only positive thing I can say is they look nice. No flavor at all. All basically tasted the same, bland and stale. Tasted old. Will not order again and thankfully I didn’t order the larger size"
They are great,5.0,Everyone loves them
Box was damaged and I am unable to return it. Super disappointed since it's a gift.,1.0,Box was damaged and I am unable to return it. Super disappointed since it's a gift.
Wonderful for gifts,5.0,I like that these Biscottis are perfect gifts. They are beautifully decorated and the taste is amazing. Not hard like most biscotti. I send a box as a gift and ordered a small size for myself. Would buy again for sure.
Waste of money,1.0,Food arrived stale. Won’t buy again.
Don't waste your money on these.,3.0,"Now, I don't know if these are meant to be stale, but they are. If they're not intended to be fresh, ok then. Basically they were a disappointment. I didn't read an expiration date. Having realized their tasteless after one bite, i threw them out!"
For gifting,5.0,Easy to order
Great Hostess Gift,5.0,Young and old like these. There is a variety of flavors and finishes. They make a great impression for the eyes and then for the taste buds.
Not disappointed here.,5.0,Definitely not bad! I wouldn't say the greatest but worth the money and would be good as a gift most definitely. I had just gotten them for myself since its harder to find chocolate dipped biscotti now a days
Not Biscotti - Poor Taste,2.0,"More of a stale cookie , crumbly, definitely not Biscotti. Really hate it when sellers mislead buyers. Would be embarrassed to gift this. Pictures make it look very nice, but that is where it ends."
Great Gift!,4.0,Gave this as a gift for a friend and she thought it was delicious! Each biscotti tasted different and the presentation was beautiful.
Delicious,5.0,I ordered the biscotti for a friend and she loved them. In fact you shared them with her neighbor and she loved them too. I will be ordering more for myself and family.

Yummy!,5.0,"Not hard and crunchy rather cake like, good flavor too"
Not happy with product at all!,1.0,"Did not taste good and look nasty. Really not happy and I purchased 2 boxes, which can not be returned."
more like a cookie...not great,2.0,not my idea of gourmet...something you would find for $3.99 at Homegoods
Underwhelming,2.0,They looked sad. The chocolate had that dried out old look. The cookie crumbled. The flavor was just like eating a store bought cookie. I was almost embarrassed I bought these for a birthday gift.
Yummy but small,5.0,Dad really enjoyed them. However I did think they were going to be bigger.
Excellent,5.0,"Smaller then I expected. But so so good and fresh even after opening 3 weeks of opening. Great for any occasion, I will keep them in my favorites!👌"
Very nice gift,5.0,Very nice gift to give for any occasion. Simple but tasty. Love with coffee.
Munchworthy,4.0,There weren’t enough! But they were crumblier than used to
Biscotti,5.0,They were very good I will order them again
Very soft for a biscotti,2.0,"They are very soft not like a biscotti at all. They really don't taste much better than something you'd get at Walmart, at least those are hard. Their pretty I guess, but look way bigger in the picture as well"
Taste,5.0,Choc is great malted milk ball is a 10
The cutest gift!,5.0,Purchased for a gift for a friend. The packaging was fabulous and so classy. The cookies looks so delicious. It also came very fast. I’ll be purchasing again. It’s very giftable!
The perfect gift,5.0,Given as gifts. All parties thought it was delicious. One said best biscotti ever.
Great gifts for colleagues,5.0,"Gave it as gifts to work colleagues and they told me they were well packaged, flavorful and tastier than othe biscotti they have eaten."
Great chocolate with a crunch,5.0,"They fit in a stocking, and with the crunch they would be great for dipping in coffee if you're into that."
Beautiful and delicious,5.0,"The package was beautiful! I was so excited to receive these. My husband and I love biscotti so I ordered them for us to enjoy on our anniversary. The customer service of this company is impeccable and they go out of their way to make sure they deliver the best products available. Highly, highly recommended."
Quality biscotti gift,5.0,Sent these as a gift to my son. He told me how he thought they were elegantly packaged and tasted of high quality.
Not as impressive as the picture looks!,2.0,"This product is a disappointment. I bought it to go in a holiday gift basket, but it's a lot smaller than what I thought it would be from the picture. The quality is also not appealing."
These are awful tasted old and leaves a bad after taste,1.0,These were not as all as described taste old
Small amount and soft biscotti,3.0,"I sent this as a gift and it was soft like a cookie, not firm like a traditional biscotti. I feel the amount you get was not worth the price."
Yum!!,5.0,I got these for a gift for my boyfriend and he loved them when he put them into his coffee in the morning. Definitely worth the buy.
These were more than I expected,5.0,The texture and taste of these treats exceeded my expectations. I was very pleased with them.
It was a gift for a dear friend,5.0,I bought this for a friend's birthday and she said they were yummy. I attached the pic and thank you she sent me. :-)
Great Gift,5.0,"Sent it to my dad, he loved it and said it was very fresh."
Gifted,5.0,I made this a part of a basket full of goodies for a friends birthday. Don't know how they tasted but they looked great!
Na,3.0,Looked bigger in the picture.
Giftable Biscotti,5.0,This was a gift for my son and he was very happy with the product.
Almost stale.,2.0,Purchased these in the past they were delicious. The last box I received were nearly stale.
Very Disappointing. Received Broken and Stale,1.0,This was to be a Christmas stocking stuffer for my biscotti loving wife. When I opened the box for a quick visual inspection I found broken crumbs floating around. Right then I knew I could not give this as a gift. I then opened the cellophane wrap for a closer visual inspection and found all pieces of biscotti were broken. I sampled one of them out of curiosity and spit it out. It was disgustingly stale. Instead of the stocking it went into the trash.
Kind seller,5.0,"Kind seller although they came damaged they were replaced without asking, very kind gesture, they also taste amazing"
Poor Quantity,3.0,Good quality. sent to 5 different families. The biggest complaint is the the Quantity barely enough for 2 people.
Not good,1.0,Dry not good flavor
Gift,5.0,The person I sent it to was wild about it!!!
Insanely overpriced,2.0,For some reason I was also misled by the photo on this page into thinking there were maybe layers in the box. Nope! It is literally 5 individual biscotti cookies. At 15 dollars a box that is THREE DOLLARS for a single cookie. Insanity. As other reviewers have said you can go to Costco or places like it and buy massive boxes of these cookies for the same price with 20X the quantity. If you have money to burn buy these. They are good but not THAT good.
Crunchy and flavorful!,5.0,I like them better than the usual biscotti because they are crunchy but not hard as a rock.
soiled and stained packaging,1.0,I assume most people buy this as a gift. For me this arrived in soiled and stained packaging unsuitable to give as a gift. It looks like it has been in a hot warehouse with brown stain marks all over it. Not the kind of gift to make the recipient feel special.

Awfully small package (4 1/2 x 7 1/4).,2.0,There are Much better values out there and you can't return them.
BAD BISCOTTI,1.0,"I sent this, as a gift, to my daughter as part of her Valentine's Day gifts. She called me and told me that she took a small bite, just to try it, and that it tasted like plastic. I told her not to throw it away, thinking that it was in her mind or her taste buds! I tried a small bite and it did taste like plastic. It tasted like very old stock that had sat so long that it took on the smell and flavor of the plastic wrapping or of the brown cover sheet. Do not send this product as a gift or purchase it for yourself. It wasn't inexpensive either. Around $3.00 per biscotti. What a waste and, even more so, how embarrassing and disappointing."
Size matters,1.0,"I bought it for myself and was shocked by the size, and I thought I only ordered one. I was shocked to get another a couple weeks later so I will gift it to my sister or someone"

All Were Broken & Crumbling,2.0,"The ad made them look appealing. These were meant as a stocking stuffer for someone in the household. I came across the box a few months later in a cabinet. I asked her if she liked them, and I was told they were all broken and crumbling. Not sure if the was caused by the age of the product, or poor packaging and damaged in transit. At $3 a cookie, I spent $15 too much."

I've always made my family's Italian recipe and I can't even figure out how any are in this tiny box.

Wonderful,5.0,For for my mothers birthday. She loved them.
Barrett's Biscotti,2.0,"To me, this is more like a cookie than biscotti . It probably should be described as a cookie and not biscotti. I prefer something crisper/drier. I feel the product is overpriced relative to its quality and size."
Great Product,5.0,Great Flavor and Great Freshness as well
Not real biscotti; not giftable!,1.0,"I’ve made real biscotti before and these were not authentic. They were more cake or cookie like and could have fallen apart of dipped in coffee or tea.

Don't waste your money!,1.0,Not really biscotti and a rip off of what you get for your money really I had to laugh when I got the package for 15 dollars there were not even 5 Normal size boscotti in it and they didn't Eben taste good not crunching more like cake. Very disappointed

Disappointed,3.0,Very small box. Looked bigger than the actual product on line.
Buyer beware - I would not recommend.,1.0,"The company must being paying for good reviews. They look nothing like the picture. When they arrived two of them were crumbled and the other ones were just sloppy looking. They are very small, not like an actual biscotti biscuit. And they tasted awful, in my opinion.

Candies,5.0,Was sent as a gift for my sister
Taste was off putting,1.0,The packaging was very nice and they looked desirable. I wanted to try these before gifting and I'm glad I did. The first one I tried was with caramel chips - it was stale and left an almost sour unpleasant after taste in my mouth. The next one was with white chocolate - stale and was almost flavorless. I didn't try the rest. It seems like they are either a hit or a miss. Mine was a miss.
Great present!,5.0,"Loved the taste, the packaging, everything!"
Too dry,3.0,Not tasty because too dry
Disappointment.,2.0,I was very disappointed. I was trying these for myself before gifted them. The biscotti taste was bland. The toppings didn't help cover up the bland taste.
No,1.0,These have 0 flavor they are not the same as real biscotti they are dry and powdery. Disappointed since I already sent one box as a gift! The chocolate topping is super thin not at all like pictures! Very expensive dust.

Crazy weird amazon reviews failed this badly for me."
Smashed and broken,1.0,Ordered this for my Mom coming for Thanksgiving. $15 for 5 biscotti. The outside of the box was perfect. Inside 2 were broken and one was smashed. Then it says it is not eligible for return. Totally disappointed.
Awful!,1.0,"These were dry and pretty tasteless. I'm a sweet-a-holic, and I threw them away. I was going to order for a friend, but I thought I'd try them as a desert at a brunch I was hosting. Fortunately I opened them ahead of time, and tried one. Horrible."

4 - cookies but a nice bow.,2.0,I should have read the other reviews before purchasing this item. It was just an add on gift for someone so it wasn’t a big deal that it was small. I didn’t open them or taste them so I’m not sure about freshness or flavor.

Excellent,5.0,Sent as a gift. Recipient was most pleased and enjoyed them immensely. Will buy again as a gift in the future.
Great gift for those with a sweet tooth,5.0,Bought these for my adult son for his Birthday . He said they were beautiful and delicious almost like candy but better .
Excellent!,5.0,"I bought the biscotti as a gift for a friend, and she was absolutely delighted! Each piece looked beautiful in the box, and she said that the flavors were delicious! The biscotti was also softer, and not rock hard like some are that could actually break a tooth, it had a wonderful texture. I'm so glad that she loved it, and I would be happy to order again for anyone including myself!"
Do not buy,1.0,Stale and gross
Perfect gift for a tea or coffee person.,5.0,I purchased this as a birthday gift. My mom loved it! She said each Biscotti was so yummy and the chocolate was very good😁. Only down side is that they were a little melted due to the Texas heat. Overall a wonderful experience and I will purchase them again.
Not impressed,1.0,Some were broken and crumbly
Great gift ideal,5.0,Great for gift giving
Yum,5.0,Ordered for a gift for my sister. She said they were fresh and tasty
It's not the same as the picture is,1.0,Disappointed
Cookies Weren't Fresh,1.0,Cookies were hard and crumbled:-/
Not worth the price,1.0,Not with the price
Received an a birthday gift,5.0,"I loved these cookies, so fresh and delicious. Thanks to my friend Dee for gifting them to me."
Send as a gift,5.0,I sent these as a gift and was told they tasted wonderful
good,4.0,it was good
"They were delicious, but chocolate was melted",5.0,"Gave the to my mom for a get well gift , Box was very pretty , difficulty a great gift to give someone , They were delicious soft not hard . But the only problem was the chocolate was melted on top , bought this in July 2022."
Tasty but Risky Shipping,5.0,"Received the box of 5 biscotti as a birthday gift but with no gift message, so, had no idea who sent them...e-chatted with Amazon customer service to find out. The biscotti were absolutely delicious and fresh -- soft and easy to chew (my preference) -- with an expiration date of 3/2023 (it's currently June 2022), and I could have eaten them all in one sitting...not difficult since only 5.

★★The ONLY problem was that Amazon, as the shipper, put the biscotti box in a thin bubble pack mailer which didn't prevent a piece of biscotti from cracking off in transit -- these DELICATE gourmet treats should have been delivered in an Amazon cardboard box larger than the item box and wrapped tightly in THICK BUBBLE WRAP that completely secured the item box from sliding or banging around during shipping to protect the biscotti from breakage. That should be the policy when Amazon ships baked goods!!!"
Gift pleases all,5.0,"Sent as a birthday gift. My sister was waiting with a cup of coffee.

Gift was very pleasing."
Product arrived damaged and broken.Taste was ok but I’d never buy again and certainly not as a gift,1.0,This was meant as a treat for my sister’s birthday. I’m so embarrassed by how it arrived

very disappointed,1.0,the taste is terrible
Mother's day gift,5.0,"I purchased this as a gift for my mom for mother's day and had it shipped to her house. She sent me a picture of everything I had sent, the box looked nice. She said they were delicious and not too hard like most biscotti. Apparently she wanted to eat them all at once, they were so good. We live 3 hours from one another, so I personally don't know how they are, but my mom absolutely loved them. Thanks for helping making mother's day a hit.😁"
DO NOT BUY....these arrive stale with no refund option,1.0,Arrived stale and had to go straight to the trash with no option for refund. Terrible!
Not even edible,1.0,I'm so bummed. Had these sent to my niece for her birthday and they were beyond melted they were soggy. Had to trash them. Super disappointed 😞
Beautiful and expensive,3.0,Nothing wrong with them. Just expensive for 5 beautiful biscotti.

Yummy,5.0,Yummy
Scrumptious!! Fresh!! Delicious!!,5.0,Absolutely scrumptious! Received as a gift. So delicious. So pretty too
Delish,4.0,My brother and wife said the cookies were imazing and we're in perfect condition when they arrived in Pennsylvania!
Flavors don't match description,2.0,"Arrived on time but 2 were broken. Description says the flavors are candied almonds, caramel chip, craisins, cookie and coconut crunch. I didn't receive the coconut crunch, instead it was peppermint. There ingredient/allergen info on the box is incorrect because it does not list the peppermint one. This is not a typical biscotti, its just a cookie and has no flavor. Pretty disappointing."
Wonderful gift to send!!,5.0,Wonderful gift to send!! I’ve sent it to a few different people. Loved by all!!!!!!!!!!!
They loved it,5.0,They loved it
Got great reviews on this gift!,5.0,"Sometimes when you send a food gift, you never know what condition/quality arrives, but I was told that these came in a beautiful box with a ribbon and every one was delicious and fresh. I will definitely order again!"
Gift Heaven,5.0,Sent as a gift; recipient raved and ate immediately!!!
Mom loved them,5.0,I got these for my Mom's birthday. They arrived to her on time. She said they were delicious and not too crunchy. She seemed very happy with them!
Great hostess gift!,5.0,Delivered and enjoyed!
Biscotti variety all tasted the same,2.0,"The various cookies tasted alike, the chocolate was soft/melted, and the cookie portion was too soft not like biscottis I’m used to eating. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone who likes a harder cookie. If you’re looking for distinctive flavors I would not suggest this assortment."
Didn't get a full box.,1.0,Paid $15 and only got 4. They are super small. Not worth the money. Went to return them because the order was incomplete and this item isnot available for returns.
Delivered and left in the sun,3.0,"These were a gift, but when delivered the driver did not knock or ring the doorbell and just left them in the sun! They melted and the biscotti was soft. I’ve never had a soft biscotti, so I’m guessing the melted chocolate had something to do with it. I cannot give an accurate review for flavor and freshness. Very disappointed in Amazon delivery, they ruined a birthday treat for my mom."
Excellent season's gift,5.0,It was an excellent season's gift
My brother loved his gift; he ate them all in 2 days😂,5.0,"The biscotti was very fresh, delicious and went very well with coffee."

Giftable,5.0,Like
Delicious,5.0,Taste and presentation
great gidt,5.0,This gift was really appreciated.
"Gourmet price,Mediocre product.",3.0,These are very small for the price. I purchased these as a gift for a friend. I was under the impression that because of the size in comparison to the price they would be gourmet quality. I was shocked to find out they were just mediocre.
Nah,3.0,Cracker part is really dry. Not my cup of tea. Bought it as a gift for my husband.
Gift Message has Impact....,4.0,"This was a Mother's day gift, arrived on time. My mother and family enjoyed. The optics are exceptional. BUMMER, the gift message was not included so there was an issue with her knowing who sent it until i texted it had been delivered and make sure it was not out in the sun/heat."
Review,3.0,Not as sweet as I thought it would be. Nice with morning coffee.
Broken and dried out,1.0,Came broken and dried out. No note either as to who sent it. It's the thought that counts and I still would have liked to have said thank you.
Trying to get replacement for damaged item,1.0,"Hello - While it looks beautiful, the product came damaged. You can see in the photo there was a large chunk missing from the last cookie. It was a gift and they were very disappointed when they opened today. It is making them hesitant to eat the biscotti because it kind of looks like someone took a bit. The return policy says a refund or replacement will be issued for a damaged item, but when I try to replace I am told the item cannot be returned. I hope that Barnett’s customer service can help resolve."
Stale,1.0,"I sent these to my mom for Christmas. She said they were powdery, crumbly and too stale to eat."
The perfect gift for someone !,4.0,"They were purchased as a gift for my grandmother for Mother’s Day. I was told they were packaged very nicely, fresh , and tasted very good. I would like to try them for ourselves in the future."
Worth it,4.0,Sent it over as a gift to multiple friends and relatives living abroad and got really good reviews from each of them. Would definitely recommend it as a gift option !
just the right gift,5.0,"Needed to find just the right get well gift for a friend...perfect size offering, great selection and a good price. Delivered as promised and all of the biscotti arrive in perfect condition and true to the image. My friend was surprised, grateful for the thought and loved the treats."
Excelente regalo,5.0,Fue un regalo
Tasty!,4.0,I bought it for my friend and she liked it. I’m not very sure how much she liked but she did mention that she enjoys.
Great price and a wonderful gift,5.0,"Highly recommended, flavor is amazing!!"
They spit it out.,1.0,I sent this to my mom after she had surgery. She and my brother each tried a piece and said it was so gross they actually spit it out! How embarrassing! I'm going to ask for a refund.
They didn’t taste great,2.0,I got them for a friend after she had surgery. They were chalky. Not good. No flavor. Would not recommend.
Great gift,5.0,"Bought this as a gift that was so well received!! Great price and a beautiful package that made a wonderful woman feel very special on her Birthday.
Will definitely regift again."
Light and delicious,5.0,It was a birthday gift!
lacks flavor and texture,2.0,"This was a gift that I sent for a birthday. It arrived on time and was wrapped nicely. The gift recipient let me taste a piece of the biscotti, and I was disappointed. It was too soft to be a biscotti, and really didn’t have much flavor. I would not purchase again."
Small and insignificant,2.0,"After sending this as a gift, the comments were that these were very small and crumbled. It was an embarrassing gift but the gift box was lovely."

good product,4.0,Very Good Tasting
A great gift idea,4.0,Very good gift
Not worth it!,2.0,"Not worth the money! Low quality, and sandy/ glass like texture."
they were all broken and so small for the price.,1.0,"They arrived long after ( 2-3 days) from the original delivery date. They fit in the slot in my mail box, so real small box. I opened them and they totally did not look like the picture, and they where crumbled and broken. Terrible packaging. You think your paying for quality, but they dont take care in packaging and the size was almost minature, not a full size biscotti. Not for the biscotti lover!!"
Taste not good,1.0,It was a gift to my brother. Taste was not that good as it was mentioned in the reviews
You want to give your relative a stale present to let them know you hate them? Look no further.,1.0,"Pretty dang stale, got these as a present from my mom along with used foot cream. I'm pretty sad. Flavor was okay, not high quality. You could probably get something of the same quality from Walmart. Walmart Biscotti might even be better. Packaging was crumby, literally, the plastic wrap had crumbs under and around the outside of the box. Which, what more could you expect from biscotti shipped via amazon? But I didn't ask for it, so here we are."
Not Impressed,2.0,They were very dry and several were broken.
STALE,1.0,I received & it tasted like saw dust in my mouth. Worst thing is they do not accept returns. I am disappointed that they will not refund.
Possibly Received A Tainted Product,1.0,I would not recommend this product at all. There is a very disgusting taste to these. I don't know if they're spoiled or if something got on them but there is definitely something not edible on these biscotti. I took one bite and immediately spit it out. had to rinse my mouth repeatedly to get the taste out.
The incredible invisible mini biscoti,1.0,Barely bigger than a few crumbs. Supposed to be a Christmas present for friends. It was so pitifully small that I was too embarrassed to give as a gift.
"Poor value, poor quality, and poor taste",1.0,What a disappointment. I bought this as a small gift to my wife on her birthday. The biscotti was not only stale but it was not even made well with fake vanilla and saw dust like texture. The only good part was the chocolate although not extraordinary.
Stale and bland,1.0,"I received this as a mother's day gift. The biscotti is crumbly, dry, and stale. It has no flavor. I only ate one and needed a whole cup of coffee to choke it down. The expiration date is 8/21. I am sure these would have been better had they been fresh."
Not great,1.0,"Not great, small package, had bought before, they shrunk in 1/2. Also were stale, fell apart in hands."
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,1.0,"Not sure why its a best seller. I order by looking at reviews but in reality its total waste of money, the item is just a biscuit with a layer of chocolate on top... its dry and not really fresh nor tasty."
Nothing great,2.0,a little on the stale side was a bit embarrassed of course since these were a gift. Lesson learned will not buy again
Awful. Do not rider.,1.0,This product was inedible. The gift recipient took one bite and threw the rest out. I would like a refund but no one has responded. It was embarrassing to have given this as a gift. “0” stars.
Extremely Overpriced / Poor Quality,1.0,I could not believe how tiny these are! Smaller than standard. And then the quality is so low! Maybe $1 each for this size and quality? I wouldn't pay a dime more.
Small and not worth it,1.0,Looked pretty tore up when it arrived. Wouldn’t buy again
Disappointed,1.0,I am very disappointed with the packaging and the taste. It was not fresh at all and my husband refused to have second bite. All the biscotti were broken.
Bad Product,1.0,I sent this product as a gift. When it was received it was as hard as a rock and some of it even looked molded. I am not a happy camper. What are you going to do to fix this problem?
Old stale biscotti fell apart !!,1.0,"The product was tasty but old

updated Review for Barnets Sweet creations,5.0,"I am updating my previous review, and giving Barnetts Sweet Creations , five stars ! Their customer service is top priority & they showed this when my first order arrived broken ,and less than fresh. They personally reached out to me and made it right. They shipped out a fresh box immediately & as you can see from the photos above they arrived in pristine condition. I appreciated the hand written note and their top notch customer service. I will actually order from them again because every business with that level of customer service deserves a second chance. I’m very pleased!! I even picked the biscotti up to show it was firm and not crumbly and smelled divine. So of course I had to make coffee to dip them in. This batch was fresh and lived up to the description. Thank you Barnetts for going the extra mile."
Bought as a gift,5.0,"I was a little worried when I got these as they were a gift & several reviewers said the cookies were broken. But they were all in perfect order when they were opened & also as many said, they are considered a Biscotti but the texture is more like a cookie. But I was told that they were Really, Really good. So it was a good gift."
Not Worth the Money,4.0,"Flavor wasn’t great. Family member said they taste like cardboard. Not even the right flavors that are stated in the description. Definitely wouldn’t buy again.

Update 9.21.21
Customer service is great! After posting about our experience, Barnett's reached out to us and 100% fixed the situation. I would highly recommend ordering directly from their site to ensure the best quality product possible."
YUCK!,1.0,"I purchased 2 boxes. I took one bite and threw them in the trash! Cookies were broken, but that’s the least of the problems. The texture is way too soft and there is no real taste to them at all. However, what you can taste is disgusting! I’ve had several “unbranded” named Biscotti’s and trust me, there is NOTHING “Gourmet” about these ones! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
