great for a gift,4.0,"more like a cookie, so not good to dip in coffee"
yum,4.0,expensive but good
Not bad but.....,4.0,A nice box for presentation. The flavors were a little bland for our taste and seemed to be a little stale. It would be giftable but I would only recommend doing so during the winter months. It was shipped with no freezer packs so things were a little melted.
Perfect gift!,5.0,"This gift was perfect for my sister (who lives far away) in celebration of her being healed from cancer. She is very grateful and biscotti is her ""luxury indulgence""."
Even though it wasn’t that great - the seller made it right,4.0,It’s very taste dependent.
fresh,4.0,The main thing to understand is that these cookies are sweet. If you like sweet then these are for you.
Great gift,5.0,My friend who received this says it is delicious.
These are not as expected,3.0,"The cookie/biscuit is more like a shortbread than an actual biscotti. They are all the same flavored cookie/biscuit with a variety of toppings. I was hoping for a variety of cookie/biscuit flavors. Ultimately not great, and they do not work well with a hot beverage like tea/ coffee/ hot chocolate. I was disappointed."
My package was damaged and can't return or replace,5.0,"This was a gift besides, getting a cake, for my sisters Birthday tomorrow. I guess I will have to get a cake. The birds and squirrels will have a nice expensive treat. Not very happy......grrrr

UPDATE!!!!
My biscotti was replaced and Barnett was very easy to work with. My sister was able to enjoy them with her evening tea"
Delicious,5.0,I send these all the time! Everyone is so happy with them
Is this really biscott?,3.0,"It's delicious, but seems more like an English tea biscuit than Italian biscotti. Or maybe Danish cookies. But not the texture of biscotti like I am.accustomed to."
Wonderful,5.0,Purchased a a gift for my mom.She absolutely love it.
They were so wonderful.,5.0,They were so wonderful. Everyone loved them. Great gift

Very nice,5.0,Exactly what I was hoping for
Buen producto,5.0,Ecxelente sabor
Light and delicious,5.0,"First time buying these to see if they were actually giftable. They are. Very elegant presentation and they taste great. They are light and crumbly, not crunchy. I like them."
Well packed,5.0,Fresh dunking and well presented
delicios!,5.0,Delicious!
Best present ever,5.0,"My son and daughter-in-law gave this to me a couple of years ago and I loved it so much I've given it as a gift a number of times. Even gave it to my husband as a gift, and lucky me he shared!"
Their small. They look big in picture but their not,5.0,Gift for someone.
Only if you serve when you open,3.0,Not very fresh. Stale within 2 days. Small and all tasted alike.
Delicious!!!!,5.0,"Purchased this for a gift for one of those people who has pretty much all she needs.
She opened it and was so surprised at how beautiful everything looked. As she was tasting, I was nervous since I never tasted them, she loved them!!!!!
Highly recommend!!"
Cookies are delicious,5.0,This was for a gift that was well appreciated
so delish,5.0,these are great and a perfect gift!
Items damaged,4.0,Items damaged
"Not quite the consistency of true biscotti, but they taste good and my wife loved them.",4.0,"I ordered these as a Mother's Day gift for a wife who has EVERYTHING. She loves biscotti, especially chocolate covered. These came nicely packaged and the toppings looked great. My wife loved them. When we tasted them, they were not hard like true biscotti; they had the consistency of a shortbread cookie. Nevertheless, they tasted great and my wife was thrilled. They were unique and she appreciated that I put some thought into her gift; not the same old, same old chocolates."
Nice presentation..,5.0,"Great appearance and delicious product..given as a gift and well
received..yum!!"
Overpriced,3.0,"I felt the cookies were tasty, but overpriced. It made a nice gift to give someone but I didn’t think they were worth it."
Very Tasty!!,5.0,"Very tasty, Delivered with all Biscottis intact, But...must have been packed on a Monday, because one was missing...Oh well"
Birthday gift,5.0,It was a gift. The person getting it said it got there on time and the family liked it.
Broken & more cake/cookie vs crisp biscotti,3.0,"Almost 25% broken. Toppings not thick enough to have real flavor, which seems to be flavor for biscotti and the actual biscotti us bland. B No crispness to expectations of biscotti which were all one note the same. They were more cake/cookie like vs. having crisp snap of a biscotti."
It was nice to send someone,4.0,we gave it for a gift
Pretty s d sweet.,3.0,They look beautiful in the box. Taste seemed dry and without flavor on the cookie part. Not solid like most biscotti. Too crumbly for dipping. Topping has different flavors. Less topping would be better.
soft and amazing taste biscotti,5.0,"My wife and I used to enjoy biscotti with daily morning coffee but we stopped having them because the ones that we had were too hard. The cookie part was so hard that we had to dip it into our coffee to soften it up but this became more of hassle than enjoying our morning coffee so we stopping eating all together.

One of our friends recommended this Barnett's chocolate biscotti because they told us it's very soft.
We were both drooling when we opened the box and could not resist all the chocolates and nuts covered on the biscotti but what really impressed us was the softness of the biscotti cookie.

The biscotti was very soft and chewy. It literally melted in my mouth while having it with my morning coffee. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed every one of them and we will be ordering some more for sure! Simply amazing."
Good gift as long as they get properly shipped,5.0,"This looked really cute to give as a gift to my dad that loves milk and cookies. Unfortunately, this was shipped in a thin plastic bag with no bubble wrap or anything extra so it offered zero protection against making the trip to my door. Delivered with a few of the cookies melted that later hardened again against the paper covering, two of the cookies are broken, the re-hardened chocolate is holding one of them back together. Awful way to present a gift, I expected more especially being considered as gourmet. Find gourmet cookies or candies to buy in a store instead so you can actually purchase them in great condition and also since this item is not returnable, wasted money.
---------------
Updated review: The company reached out to me, refunded and offered to replace the box with better shipping. Last year for Christmas I got their chocolate covered sandwich cookies as a gift which were great, ordering during the summer and biscotti being a bit more fragile you can see would need more prep to ship. Although I had already gifted the damaged box of cookies, the box itself that they were stored in was cute and the biscotti did smell great. I appreciate Barnett's for going above and beyond to fix the error, good customer service so you can order with confidence."
Biscotti,3.0,NOT WORTH THE MONEY
Really nice assortment and flavors,4.0,"We really liked these - it was a bit of an unusual gift. The assortment and the flavors were terrific, but they dry out very quickly, so you better plan to eat them quickly."
Looks Delicious....NOT!,2.0,"Definitely one of those purchases where I wish I had heeded to warning of previous buyers. This product showcases nicely, and that's where the enjoyment ends. Everything tasted bland, absolutely flavorless. Definitely not worth the price. I'm sure more people will buy these cookies, thinking they can't possibly be that bad, and like those of us before them, many will be disappointed."
Tiny,5.0,"Tiny cookies, 3 bites and gone but good."
Was a gift. They loved them,5.0,Was a gift they raved about how delicious they were
Wonderful gifts in past orders. But this one was in CRUMBLES.,4.0,"I reached out to get a ""replacement"". I'm in process of awaiting a reply.
UPDATE: We received a replacement box in tip-top condition. This company was very responsive and I would shop with them again and again. Great gifts."
Makes a nice gift.,5.0,"I have ordered it as a gift to a few friends and received much thanks. Honestly, I have never tried it myself. But... it seems to make a good gift"
Melted Chocolate,3.0,"I bought three of these Biscotti Gift Boxes, one box came with melted chocolate. Not good."
Cookies!,3.0,Good selection but wasn't as fresh as I'd hope for. The family ate them in one night
Tasty,4.0,These are super yummy. But the package was totally messed up. And some of the chocolates melted off while in shipping.
The best,5.0,An excellent gift!
Disappointing for the price,3.0,"While these treats tasted good, they arrived broken and with some of the toppings melted."
Bought As A Good Gift,5.0,"This box of biscotti was sent to a beloved friend. They said they loved it! It opened up in a good aroma of vanilla and chocolate. The only complaint was that it looked TOO gourmet, haha! Good gift for a good friend."
Excellent,5.0,Delicious
Great Gift Idea,5.0,"Here is something to get for a person you care about and yet you’re not sure what to get as a gift. It is sweet, and special enough to say you care!"
Dry.,3.0,"Each had the same flavor, bland vanilla."
They were all melted,3.0,They were all melted and out of place
A gift for my brother for his birthday I liked it very elegant,5.0,I was so happy ordered it got it the same day Amazon awesome it comes in a nice box with a black bow I knew my brother would love it and he called and really did.
Delicious but….,4.0,"Delicious, six different biscotti, beautiful box. Problem was five were broken, broke more trying to remove from box."
Beautiful presentation,5.0,"I got this box for my boss' birthday. Biscotti's are her favorite, so these were absolutely perfect. There are 12 in the box and you get 2 of each type. They're covered in either white, milk or dark chocolate. The 3 white chocolate ones have either cookie crumbs, dried cranberries or coconut on top and the 3 covered in milk or dark chocolate have either caramel chip, almond crunch or peppermint on top. They come in a super cute box. I love the teal letters and accent colors on the box and it's even better that the box has Happy Birthday already marked on it. I didn't even have to wrap it! If you want a birthday present that will wow the recipient, this will do the trick."
Quick delivery,4.0,They were delicious
Mother loved this,5.0,Got this as a Mother's Day gift. She loved it.
Mom's Day Gift!!,5.0,"My mom lives Biscotti, so when I came across this posting I knew it'd be perfect. It ships in a decent amount of time, it's super sealed, and they were really pretty!! The only issue is that the flavors and toppings aren't listed anywhere on the box or inside packaging. So I had to come back to this post to screenshot n send to her. So that was a damper. But all in all a good gift!!"
Awesome gift!,5.0,This was a gift for my mom. It was the perfect gift for her! She loves her biscotti and can be a little picky about the ones she gets so the variety was perfect for her. She said they were all delicious!
From frown to crown 🙂👑,5.0,"While the cookies look very nice and delicious, the carefully wrapped package was missing a cookie making it ungiftable.

UPDATE: Based on the above review, the company reached out to me about my dissatisfaction. To their credit, they were genuinely concerned about the product I received. They went way above and beyond to make sure I was happy. Since the first review, I can definitely upgrade my review to five stars, six if I could. Also, my family gathered and I served the biscottis to rave reviews on the taste and texture. I will be a return customer and suggest you do the same. You won’t be disappointed ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
Good,5.0,It was good for a gift
Delicious,5.0,"Dear Barnett's, I hope you get this message. I bought these biscotti for our family in Australia. Since you are Australian living in NJ ,I thought our cousins would appreciate it and think it was pretty funny. Well they were sent off in a package with some other gifts. Unfortunately the Australia Post took possession of our package and wouldn't let it go through customs because I had sent some tomato seeds. Even though they were completely sealed up,seeds are a no no. Why they didn't just take the seeds out and send the package on its way is a mystery to me. They sent the whole package back to NJ. So your biscotti went over 20,000 miles and not one of them broke. Anyway I just wanted you to know how good your packaging is and if you haven't been home for a visit lately at least some of your biscotti had a quick visit.
BTW they are delicious"
Only beautiful packaging.....inside is a mess!,4.0,"The biscotti came in beautiful packaging but when we opened them half of the biscotti were cracked, there were lots of crumbs everywhere. When we tasted them there was no flavor, and they did not taste fresh. I would not recommend this product as giftable. It's nothing like the picture shows.

UPDATE: 3-3-21
I had contacted the seller and Adley gave me a full refund and actually sent another package of the cookies and asked to let her know how these looked and tasted. These tasted a looked about the same as the first ones so I am not too happy about that. I am very impressed with their customer service though. Thanks Adley!"
Biscotti not great and too soft,3.0,Wasn’t crazy about any of the flavors and disappointed in the lack of crunchiness. Biscotti in my experience is supposed to be dunk-able in your coffee but there is no way you could dunk these; they were too soft. Didn’t care for the flavors. Recipient opened and shared immediately with me; I was embarrassed at quality for price.
Mmmm,4.0,"Well they are good, but as a mexican that eats alot of pan dulce i don't think I'll buy another box, not worth the price, i can easily go to my local panaderia and gen double the bread half the price and like x4 times the amount"
They were ok but stale,3.0,They were stale
received replacement thank you!,5.0,good and fresh biscotti
Biscotti,5.0,The biscotti were delicious!
The Biscotti Cookies are VERY SOFT and not the firm crisp ones like from Italy.,2.0,Half the box had broken cookies due to shipping and softness of the product.
I give these as a gift,4.0,My only negative is that the write does not tell you that they are minis only about 2.5 inches long. Need to eat 2 or three of them at once. to equal a full size one.
Really yummy!,5.0,"Have previously written a review for this item, however, this item was found to be extremely yummy from a person who is hard to please. Arrived quickly, tasted great, nice variety, and I was told definitely worth buying again!!"
A really great gift,5.0,This gift really cheered up my best friend so far awsy. She was delighted with texture and flavour.
Disappointed!,2.0,These were advertised as biscotti but they are not! They’re just crumbly cookies….they don’t even look as nice as picture. So disappointed! And they weren’t fresh…tasted old.
Very delicious,5.0,It was an excellent gift.
Good product - Good company,5.0,"After receiving the initial order, found crushed biscotti. I suspect it was via delivery but had no way of knowing. Previous orders had always arrived in tact.
The company immediately reached out (reading my review) and sent another order. Outstanding customer service. They sent several communications along the way and it is apparent that they truely value their customers. The biscotti is of excellent quality and I will continue to order from Barnett's."
Dry & Broken.,2.0,Dry and broken.. More like sugar cookies that biscotti.
Mom loved them,5.0,I sent them to my mom she said they were taste and she loved them she told me a great gift
"Stale, tasteless, crumbly - update 03/02/2021 - 4 stars for their outstanding customer support",4.0,"I don't know where those high reviews came from, but I will never by this product again. After the initial dive into the box no one would eat any more so they were thrown into the trash.

03/02/2021 - The company provided me with a full refund. Pretty unexpected and quite impressive. They also asked if that could replace the box we had received to see if there may have been a problem with the one we got. We sampled it today and found this box was much better than the previous one. They certainly stand by their product."
Not traditional hard biscotti,4.0,Not traditional biscotti was soft. Bland. All varieties tasted the same.
Check the expiration date!,3.0,"CHECK the expiration date sticker on the bottom of the box before eating! Amazon has apparently been sending out old stock from the back of the warehouse. I ordered a box in May 2021 and received one with an expiration date of 5/1/2019! Yuck!!!!

The company, when contacted directly, did send me a replacement item. And they were tasty. However, the gentleman in customer service said it had just been baked that day and the expiration date was 1/15/2022. What kinds of preservatives are in these that they last for 8 months? My box that was several years old looked exactly like my box that was fresh. Identical. I would absolutely have eaten them if I hadn't happened to see the date. And, by the way, that means that the first box I received would have been baked in 2018! Ick."
They look better than they taste,4.0,They are pretty sweet biscotti.
Package must have been old,3.0,"Sticky, melted, and stuck to package"
My daughter and son in law loved them.,5.0,Looked and tasted as shown.
Taste,5.0,Love them as a treat with coffee. Gift them to my sister-in-law as she has lots of allergies ta additives BUT she can eat and loves cookies!!
Mornings are so much sweeter,5.0,The cookies are the perfect size for dunking in tea or coffee. The chocolate ones are the best. The cookies are sweet enough that it's not necessary to use sugar in the beverage. It's hard stopping at just one!
Not worth price,3.0,Not that flaverful
Love the good taste and the portion.,5.0,"I'm not a real biscotti fan...Generally speaking...but these are absolutely great! I’ve tried it out and totally in love. Me and my family of 4 love these cookies very much and we will definitely buy them again. They are not the usual type of hard biscuit, they are more like biscuit, but not too sweet, icing and various toppings make them more perfect. Will definitely buy them again."
Not a favorite,3.0,A bit on the dry side. Hubby did not like and will not order again. I have had much better.
Mother's Day Ooooopppsss,5.0,"SO there was an Oooooppppssss made when we ordered this item for a Mother's Day Present. The Amazon box arrived in perfect condition and so did the Barnett's Box inside. The problem was the Barnett's Box was completely empty, not even a crumb, like the box got skipped when they were filling them. Adley at Barnett's Sweet Creations went way above and beyond to correct this mistake. She refunded us, sent a fresh box out to Mom and sent one to us. More than what I expected. The best part was the biscotti, the wife and kids loved them. Mom liked hers too. Thanks Again Adley. We would order these again, just based off of the customer service."
They arrived melted!,2.0,"Was a gift for my mother! She stayed home and waited for the delivery. She picked up the package within 2 minutes of arrival (off porch). Mom said they were all melted, but told me they were very good 'because i bought them for her!' Not to worry please, ""I will eat them anyway!"""
"Good ,but Overprice",4.0,"They looks better on the website , and I think it’s over price ,,,the flavors not bad at all ,,,, disappointment with the box ,"
Too sweet.,2.0,Too sweet.
They are fantastic!!!!!,5.0,Have ordered these in the past and there are fabulous!!!
Not worth the money…,2.0,"The biscottis were melted and messed up, which we thought, ‘okay, they will make up in flavor what they lack in presentation.’ Nope, wrong. They tasted stale and bland. I would pay maybe 10$ for this product, but definitely not 40$."
My sister loved them.,5.0,Gift. Sister loved it.
"Tiny little cookies, more like samples than full size cookies.",4.0,"The size of the cookies is a little deceiving. They are not full size cookies as you would see in a bakery or grocery store. the box is 12 in. wide and there 3 cookies across. With the gaps left between cookies the actual size of the cookies is about 3 inches, not the normal 5ish you would get at the store. For nearly $40 I was expecting full size cookies. They have a return policy and will likely send these back and just get some store bought ones. The quality appears to be top notch, they are all well made and look delicious, just can't get past the price/size ratio.
Update: Barnett's offered a full refund in light of my dissatisfaction of the cookie size. Due to their customer service i have changed my rating to 4 stars. My wife also confirmed that the quality of the cookies was good, everyone she shared them with enjoyed them and they weren't stale or broken as some other reviewers have experienced."
"Very good,great gift",4.0,"Great flavor, nice selection"
More shortbread than biscotti,2.0,These are small and more like shortbread than biscotti. You’d do best to just buy Nonni’s.
Easy to work with,4.0,"I had an issue with my order. However, they were very accommodating in taking care of it. Thank you!"
Tasty however more of a crisp cookie than a traditional biscotti,5.0,"I was gifted a box of these last Christmas and managed to stretch them into February. I decided to just purchase my own. I seldom find a treat that I can not live comfortably without.

Now to the review of the product. A three by one inch with a slight variation in size between the four types. Each covered frosting/icing with decorations, nuts chocolate chips etc. which is slightly sweeter than the cookie. The cookie is mildly sweet similar to most cakes. The one with the white topping with a chocolate drizzle and raisins is fragile and tends to break. The rest did not break apart when taking them out of the box. The cookie itself are all the same flavor except to the topping. I would like to see other flavors but enjoy them as they are."
Box came damaged. Product was dry.,3.0,"The box was damaged when it arrived, the biscotti’s were dry and the icing was melted."
Not a traditional biscotti.,4.0,"These are beautifully decorated and packaged. However, I would not reorder in the summer months. They arrived with the icing melted to the paper on top of them. They are good, fresh and soft. Too soft to dunk in coffee. They might make a good gift for someone who is not expecting biscotti but a soft cookie."
If you've had1 you've had them all,4.0,"Liked the flavor. Just too much of the same. Texture was more of a cookie than that of a biscotti
However they were were fresh and made a great presentation."
Great gift,5.0,Got these as a birthday gift for my sister. She loves biscotti with her coffee and she said these were excellent.
It was more of a very dry shortbread than biscotti and crumbled before you could dip in tea.,3.0,I like to dip in tea. It was a dry shortbread that crumbled when you took a bite and dissolved when dunking. Very pricey for the quality.
Great Product and good delivery system,5.0,"This is the second time that I ordered….product is fresh, well presented and the delivery was on time.
My daughter love them."
Stale and crumbly,2.0,Very disappointing product.
Freshness and flavorful,5.0,"I received this as a gift for Valentine’s Day and I have to say, it was a great gift. It was delicious and I was surprised how fresh it was. I just ordered my second box last week. I highly recommend anyone to buy this for a gift or for yourself"
Riquísimos,5.0,Su sabor y frescura muchas felicidades !!!
The Thrill Is Gone,3.0,"Beautifully and sturdily boxed. Nice to look at a a newly-opened box. But the cookies seem all the same and the frosting, while different in colors, does not have a lot of difference in taste."
Good gift,4.0,Nice box. Great gift presentation. Very dry biscotti.
Barnett’s Biscotti Cookies,4.0,"great gift, cookies are very dry, good for dipping"
Beautifully packaged,3.0,Purchased as a gift. Packing was beautiful. These are not your traditional biscotti. These are more of a cookie (soft). They were tasty and very pretty.
To Sweet,3.0,The cookie itself lacked flavor. The chocolate covering was a little sweet but the toppings were good.
Delicious Gift,5.0,I have sent these to my daughter in law twice. She says they are delicious and loved having a tea party with my grand daughter. Will certainly order again!
Broken,2.0,They arrived broken and messy
Good cookies!,4.0,The flavor was excellent but they arrived all broken up. If the biscotti were in one piece they would make a really good gift.
Delicious and fresh,5.0,These are delicious and fresh biscotti. I like that they are not hard and dry but softer and very flavorful.
Consistency Great!,5.0,Highly recommend
They taste ok,3.0,They taste ok. They are like crunchy shortbread but drier.
Really good,5.0,Got this for my dad for Father’s Day. Box was beautiful. Packaging was tight and nice. He loved them.
Not really biscotti.,3.0,Not bad cookies. Nice packaging. Not biscotti tho.
Attractive but not really biscotti,2.0,"The packaging is beautiful and the impression when you open the box is very nice. But these are not twice baked, and the cookie itself is bland and dry. Dry would be fine if it were a true biscotti, but it is more like a biscuit, and not a good one. The height varied, some pieces were thin ends. I would not purchase these again."
it was more like shortbread than biscotti,4.0,gift
"Taste good, but crumbly",3.0,"These are tasty, but not the consistency I expect from biscotti. It's closer to an over dried shortbread than the biscotti I've had from other places."
OK,3.0,"Not quite what I expected. More ""cakey"" than hard biscuit. Doubt I'll purchase again. There are so many good supermarket options. This was a gift so it made a better ""presentation"" than store bought."
Great Biscotti,5.0,"Great biscotti, awesome for gifting. Not skimpy looking, definitely a generous amount. The flavors were good, freshness on point, makes for a great snack or gift giving. Will definitely order it again."
Look twice,3.0,"I bought these as a sample for possible corporate gifts. While they were nicely boxed, just about all of them were broken. So, I would never use them as gifts. And, they all tasted the same."
Good cookies,4.0,Tasty!
A lovely presentation of biscotti.,3.0,"I liked the packaging, appearance and the amount of biscotti. I was concerned that the pieces did not have the firm texture I associate with biscotti. The product needs to be firm because biscotti is used to dip in coffee and hold together after dipping. I enjoyed mine more after being opened a few days giving it strength to hold up to dipping. I did not like so much chocolate flavored pieces. Not really bad but room for improvement."
Delicious!,5.0,I got this for my Dad! He loved it!
Great Valentine gift,5.0,"It was late but according to hubby….they are delicious! He’s rationing them carefully as he’s tempted to eat the whole box!
I got one and it was moist, fresh and just the right amount of sweetness. I would definitely buy them again."
Really nice gift for sweet lover!,5.0,I bought it as a Christmas gift for my boss and after a couple days he came to me and told me that it tasted really good. The box itself looked really nice too. I didn’t get to see what’s inside tho cause when I got it the box was wrapped and sealed. I think it’s the perfect gift for people that likes sweets!
A Great Surprise,5.0,I bought this as a recovery gift for my sister who just got out of the hospital. It was the best thing because she loved it. She never had a Biscotti before in her life. Thank you for helping me bring back her smile and to forget temporarily her discomfort. 😊
Chocolate deliciousness,3.0,Loved the biscotti. I did feel that were not as fresh as they should be. I wonder if packaging them individually rather than in one open tray might solve this issue. However the flavors were delicious and I have enjoyed them with coffee
Mom loved them and that's what matters.,5.0,So far my mother is really enjoying them and going on 84 yrs old that's all that matters is to keep my mom happy !
Expected a fresher tastier purchase.,3.0,Flat in flavor and was not as fresh as expected.
Perfect gift item,5.0,"Beautiful package, decorated Biscotti had a softer more traditional bite and flavor. Recipient loved them."
These cookies not only look spectacular they taste delicious!,5.0,"You know when something looks good but the taste is disappointing. Well, look no further! I found a gem !!!!!
I ordered many boxes of these cookies for people as a gift for different occasions. They told me the presentation and cookies were delicious !
So, this Valentines Day 2021, I ordered a box for my sweetheart and he was extremely happy with the look and taste of these cookies.
Now that I know they look good and taste even better I will continue to order from this company!
Thanks for making a fantastic product!"
Waste of Money,1.0,This was an expensive purchase in the hope that it could be a treat when serving my friends coffee. The box itself arrived without any evidence of damage but most of the biscotti were broken. The icing was attractive but the cookies were too soft to dunk in coffee without dissolving. A Nilla Wafer covered in icing would out taste this product.
They were delicious,5.0,"My only disappointment was that they were delivered late. They were a mother's day gift.
Weather was a factor so forgiven."
Just Okay... Not Traditional Biscotti... Dry & Crumbly... & OMG SUPER EXPENSIVE!!!,2.0,"I thought with all the rave reviews, these cookies... and let's call them cookies because they're not biscotti in the traditional sense... they'd be better. They're not. Although not terrible they're basically light, dry, crumbly vanilla cookies, shaped like a biscotti, with a variety of thin toppings that make them look different from one another, but taste basically the same.

Each cookie is approximately 21 grams, so with 24 cookies to the tray, and a $40 price tag that comes out to a price per pound of about $36 (or $1.67 per cookie if you like). You're MUCH better off going to an Italian bakery that makes REAL biscotti or buying Nonni's Biscotti which are better. Sad to say, I've had better supermarket biscotti at 1/4 of the price.

Last year I gave a box of these as a gift and got a very nice report back from the recipient... now I know they were just being kind. Never again."
Disappointed,1.0,"Bought this as a gift and was really excited but felt let down after several issues.
1. Two delays meant it arrived 5 days later than planned, even though it's meant to be Prime item.
2. The box was damaged and not in a state to be presented as a gift to someone. The color and packaging is beautiful in the images but my box had bends and paper peeling off.
Overall, I actually wondered if it was a return from someone else and there was no quality control when it was packaged to be sent to me."
Arrived partially melted,4.0,"One row melted to top of package on arrival. Of course, it was June in Florida, so chocolate delivery is a risk. Dad loved it for Father’s Day anyway and licked it off the top."
Packaging was damaged and not giftable,3.0,This was ordered as a gift. Edges of box were damaged beyond what I am comfortable gifting. We decided to keep it for ourselves only to see that nearly half the biscottis were broken into 2 and 3 pieces. Very flavorful but so disappointing that it could not be the gift I intended for the considerable price. Would have returned but am aware that opened food items are not returnable.
Great Gift !,5.0,"We are a small company and ordered these as Christmas gifts for our customers. We place an order a couple years ago and received many called backs from our customers thanking us and telling us how amazing these were. We ordered a sample box this year to ensure it was the same quality before shipping it to our customers, it totally was. I love the presentation of it, you can tell they put a lot of time and effort into making this product as delicate as possible. Please be advised, if cookies do come broken, it's not the vendors fault, we watched as our delivery man dropped the box in our office, I can only imagine how they handle it in their facilities. Overall great product and great gift, plus their customer services is above and beyond !"
Pretty but fairly tasteless,3.0,"Was disappointed in this purchase and wished I had tasted it before sending several out as Christmas gifts first. They do a great job with pretty packaging and pretty frosting on the biscotti but the cookie itself is tasteless and excessively crumbly (even for a biscotti). The sugary frosting does nothing much for flavor but looks pretty. The biscotti are also small. If it wasn't for the pretty factor, would give only 2 stars at best. Instead, go to Costco, if you are a member, and get their big plastic jar of authentic anise-flavored biscotti (no stupid frosting) which are world's better in flavor and texture."
NOT QUITE ACCEPTABLE FOR GIFT,4.0,THE BISCOTTI WERE FINE BUT THE BOTTOM OF THE GIFT BOX THEY WERE IN WAS SMASHED. THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO RETURN ITEM BECAUSE I NEEDED IT FOR A GIFT THAT NIGHT.
Delicious and impressed the giftee!,5.0,"I'm a guy, so lets be honest about something. I ordered these for Valentines Day because the box looked pretty. Candy looked yummy. Win win! Until yesterday I didn't know what a Boscotti was, but guess what, my wife sure does and she loves them it turns out. Nearly 20 years and we still learn new things. Awesome. Anyways I also loved them, but what really set this candy box apart from anything I usually buy was the cool note on the inside. I found it endearing and it added a real authenticity to it. My wife thinks I went out and found these some place and would not guess in a million years they came from Amazon.

Very well done! Will order from again! Oh yeah, a note to the baker, the ones with fruit on em.. MMMM MMMM MMMM!!!"
Just ok,3.0,I got it as a gift and I was disappointed. It looks different and a lot better in the pictures.
Excellent gift!,5.0,Superb choice as a gift especially for birthdays or holidays.
Barnett's Biscotti Cookies,4.0,"The box of 24 biscotti contained 8 different varieties. All were tasty. I was impressed with customer service. When there was an issue with our order, the company responded quickly and we were happy with the resolution of the problem."
No one complained,4.0,Assume all was good as they were eaten and no complaints
Perfect little bite !,5.0,"These are a cross between a shortbread cookie and a biscotti , very good , nice toppings . Don’t listen to the negativity, they are good , really good . I love them dipped in coffee !"
complaint,4.0,"Product contained chocolate, should have a climate control package, was not given to resident as stated and left out in the sun.. I also wrote a note that was not included!"
Stale,2.0,They were not fresh
Delicious biscotti for the holidays,4.0,Very delicious person I sent it to was very pleased with the overall taste and presentation beautiful box of cookies some were cracked but the seller was very helpful. I would recommend to all my friends and to anyone looking for a nice gift for the holidays
Not my favorite,3.0,The box was very pretty and the decorations on the pieces was lovely. I expected the hard dunkable biscotti. This was crumbly like a shortbread and be tasted stale and grainy.
Disappointed,4.0,"Very small slices, didn't very fresh."
Great gift. Very good biscotti.,5.0,"The frlavor was excellent. The freshness was surperb
The selection is awesome."
Delicious and nice presentation,5.0,Came in nice packaging and cookies were delicious. Makes a nice gift.
So...good!!,5.0,"I wanted to purchase more than two since I want one for myself lol, but they won’t let me, but I do understand. They only limit two per person, so I purchase the sampler one for myself to try. I don’t normal have sweet tooth or crave for sweets, but I can’t stop eating this once I tried it. I ended up keeping one of the big box for myself 🙈. Omg! What have I done! It’s so good! I can’t help it. Perfect for afternoon tea."
Delicious,5.0,Very fresh. Delicious. Very soft. Cute presentation. Very cute box with a bow. Would def order again. Def recommend!
Custom note DOA...,3.0,The Biscotti Cookies I heard were delicious... but the Merry Christmas attachment note never made it with the gift. Not sure who's to blame but this 'gift' was lost in translation.
Good quality,5.0,Great gift
Not My Favorite,3.0,"Sorry Amazon but this one is iffy. Yes the product is dryish, but it also lacks taste. I would not gift it. You decide. Pretty box and display."
Best gift for biscotti lovers,5.0,"I'd take a photo but an empty box isn't very appealing :) Honestly, my wife loves getting this as a gift & I like that she lets me eat some too!"
STALE.. *they were replaced* and much better,4.0,"These are stale and just gross! It says you can’t return them! So I just wasted 40.00!
**Update** so without asking I was sent another box of these and they are much better. Not stale, good flavor. Thanks!"
Mother's Day Gift,5.0,"My wife loves hem, much better than just a box of chocolates !!!"
Fantastic gift and treat!!,5.0,"I bought these for my mom who is turning 80 in November as a ""pre-birthday"" gift. She LOVES sweets, would rather eat cake than anything else. I was on the phone when she opened the box and she ate one right away, and she was really impressed. It's really not easy to impress my mother, who is German, and makes homemade bake goods like you wouldn't believe how great. So that was a thumbs up as far as I am concerned. I also ordered a box for myself just because I wanted to make sure of the quality, and I am very pleased with the quality of this product. I hope everyone else enjoys these and that your shipment turns out as great as ours."
'So this happen,1.0,I wrote a not so good review because the product that I got and gave one for a gift.. Were awful tasted old and the chocolate all melted.So dry when we tryed to pick it up it just crumbled not like a Biscotti. So got email addressed to the person that I gave gift to. And trying to make it right with a 25.oo gift card to take down my review..So reposting this.
Disappointed,3.0,"Gave as gift, I was disappointed when they opened up the gift and was passing it around to share"
Biscotti cookies were stale.,2.0,Even the topping did not taste fresh. For the price you expect better quality. Do not recommend product
Melted..,3.0,"Arrived via UPS, so it sat on a hot truck, unfortunately when I lifted off the cover all the chocolate toppings stuck to the top. So the presentation at that point dint look so great at all. Taste was ok, have had better and have had worse so in this falls in the middle, pieces were a bit smaller than expected and compared to what expected…"
Tasty but arrived broken,2.0,"They tasted very good, but most of them were broken when they arrived so it was a little embarrassing when they were opened."
Not super fresh,3.0,"The flavor was ok- but not what I would consider giftable. The chocolate had a film on them and looked old.
Will not order these again."
So Good!,5.0,"I tasted this product at Christmas. It was delicious, so when I saw Amazon carrying it, I was quick to pick it up as a birthday gift for someone dear to me. Yes, it arrived, as others have said, in a rather disheveled way. The handsome packaging was all askew, and I had to untwist the ribbon and re-fastun it. I could, I did. No big deal. That kind of thing doesn't happen often with Amazon, so I just overlooked it. The biscottis themselves were well covered and dated for freshness. A label said they'd last until May sometime, and, if they don't, I hope my son will complain. But, chances are they will have been devoured by then, With three of us in the house, they only lasted three days at Christmas!!"
There was no place to add a message .,3.0,There was no place to add a message.
I wouldn’t buy it again,3.0,"Taste is just regular. Look is not the same nice like on photos, all toppings seems to taste similar"
There were some that didn't;t make the trip too well. Melted chocolate and a couple broken.,4.0,"It was personal for our home, so I'm glad we did not gift it."
Fresh and delicious,5.0,Wonderful product. I used it as a gift for someone who has a coffee bar. They were well presented with the box packaging as well as extremely flavorful
Delicious & beautifully presented,5.0,I sent these as a gift for a friend. She loved them! Yummy gift treat in beautiful presentation.
"Delicious, but too high in cholesterol.",4.0,"According to the label on the box of biscotti, one of the latter contains 110 milligrams of cholesterol. That is an astronomical amount, so I would advise caution if the recipient has a cholesterol issue."
Stale/ SECOND CHANCE,5.0,"I love biscotti but these were stale, had an off-taste. They should dump when no longer fresh.

12/10/22. Tried second purchase and this order was delicious!"
Biscotti texture,2.0,Tastes good but definitely not a biscotti texture. Tastes more like a cookie than biscotti.
The only difference in each flavor is the topping.,3.0,"I'm sorry, but I'm not enjoying them."
Big disappointment,3.0,"Very disappointed in these. They are more like shortbread than biscotti, very dry and flavorless. Will not order again."
Blah flavor for biscotti!,3.0,Nothing unusual about these. The best thing about this product was the box presentation!
Disappointed,3.0,These are a soft & I prefer a crunchy biscotti. They are tasty.
perfect gift for far away friends,5.0,"Many friends are far away and searching for gifts can be tough. I sent these to a friend in LA who is very picky and she loved them, even complaining that her sons were home and she had to share :) Since then I have bought them for two other friends, all of whom live in places with Italian bakeries. They were a hit. They are now my go-to gift and need to really buy a box for myself!"
Was a gift selection,5.0,Recipients indicated arrived fresh
That they are fresh & tastes fine.,4.0,"This was a gift. We got to see the biscotti & one of them was thin & half the size. We’ll see how they taste. They will inform us. So they were fresh & tastes fine. We thought they were a bit bigger than what they are because they looked larger in the photo, but good."
Dry,3.0,These taste good but they are really dry and mine got here broken and some were crumbly. Very Dry.
Great Gift for the Coffee Lover in your life,5.0,My dad is hard to shop for but loves biscotti with his coffee. Came across this and got it for him for Christmas. It’s mid-January and I think he ate it all already!!!
"Call it my unrefined palette, but.....",3.0,"There is one particular biscuit flavor that tastes like, well, vomit. It's the cream-colored one and I believe it is officially ""Coconut"", but it is horrible. I bought this as a gift for my wife, and the rest of the biscuit flavors are very good, but the vomit-flavored one is gag-worthy. In fact, my 21-year-old son quietly excused himself and gagged in the bathroom after trying it. My wife confirmed that the one flavor was terrible, and she is not picky in the least. I decided to try it myself, although I can't stand coconut, and I can confirm it: it tastes like vomit. Like I mentioned, the rest of the flavors are good, I just can't imagine who yelled ""It's a winner!!"" in the test lab when the vomit-flavored biscuit was being developed."
Not priced appropriately,2.0,"Honestly way overpriced. The biscotti are small and not hard, don’t have the traditional biscotti flavor, and the way they’re topped is unimpressive and not very tasty. This product shouldn’t be a penny more than $25 and even at that price I wouldn’t buy them again."
Melted but yummy,2.0,"Product was melted when it arrived. It would have been a great product but most of the chocolate was stuck to the top wrapper. Presentation was a plus for a gift, but I am glad I did not send it as one."
Top notch,5.0,Delicious and so decadent
Old,1.0,"I am sorry to report this because I wanted this to be good. I ordered this for my sister-In -Law's birthday and when I received it it was smashed on one corner and the plastic wrap was torn. I thought I could just take off the plastic wrap and I could still give it to her. But there were crumbs inside the plastic wrap. I opened the box up and the biscotti's were melted (understandably because it is July) and it smelled very old. It had been jostled around so much that the fine crumbs from the biscotti were covering the inside of the box. But it mostly just smelled old, almost rancid. If I can use that term for a cookie box. I know I am taking a gamble purchasing food but I tried and it failed."
Not what I expected,2.0,I expected a hard cookie to soak in my coffee. Most of the frosting was on the plastic covering.
Absolute winner as gift. Not too much not too little. Something different from the usual.,5.0,Something different from the normal gift. I gave to my wife for Valentine’s Dsy instead of candy. It was a big hit. It’s wonderful with coffee.
"They were terrible, not what I expected. Broken👎",1.0,They were dry and some were broken. For the price I expected a lot more. Nonna's biscottis are sooo much tastier and better. They are way overpriced and would like a refund.
Great gift for hubby,5.0,Bought these as a Valentines Day gift for my coffee loving husband and he said they were delicious
For a full refund,4.0,"These are just mediocre. Doesn't justify the cost nor the premium quality they are trying to sell.
Update: they have fully refunded my purchase, so update the ratings from one to four. They also believe that the boxes I received could be an anamoly and customers are usually happy with their product."
They were ok,3.0,"They were a gift. Arrived on time. I asked her how it was She said she had to put in fridge right away, chocolate was all melted. Taste was ok. Box said Happy Birthday! So by that I don’t believe it was a wow…"
"Not that great and smaller than regular biscotti, bland cookies!",2.0,These are the same cookie topped with little sprinkle balls that felt like my teeth were chipping then such a small amount is crushed candy cane that you could barely tell it was there. The others were similar a few pieces of what seemed to be chopped peanut. I will stick to Nonni’s as they at least have a decent size Biscotti with whole almonds a rich dark chocolate topping and drizzle you can taste. Plus they flavor the cookies. These were too bland! Live and learn it is not the wrapping but the gift inside you should be happy with!
Not your traditional Biscotti,3.0,"This is a nicely presented assortment, and people who have never had anything resembling Italian biscotti or even the American coffee shop version thereof may find these enjoyable. However, the texture is crumbly soft, not crisp and freshly firm, and therefore not suited to dunking in coffee or softening in one’s mouth with a swallow of coffee. At that point, just select some cookies you like and forget about the biscotti concept."
These were disappointing. They are cookies not biscotti,1.0,I was expecting biscotti not cookies. I gifted them to out of town family and the left them here and I don’t want them either. Beautifully packaged but product was a disappoint.
Nice variety,4.0,They arrived in one piece and had no issues of them being in pieces as others have a had. There is a nice variety of different types in the order. I know taste is subjective however they all tasted the same to us and left a distinct aftertaste. Still giving it 4 stars since taste between people can be subjective as mentioned earlier and had no issues with the product.
Too soft for a biscotti,3.0,The flavors were good but they are way too soft for a biscotti. They are giftable.
nice and delicious Biscotti Cookies,4.0,this is my first time buying this Biscotti Cookies. They are really good specially with a cup of Coffee. They have a natural flavor and they taste fresh. I am going to buy it again.
It’s NOT biscotti!,3.0,It’s NOT biscotti!
This is not Biscotti.,2.0,"When it arrived via USPS late I wasn't surprised but no biggie. When my wife and I first picked one out we looked at each other and said they were kind of light. I make Biscotti and do it several different ways and this is not one of them. These are cookies with sweet toppings. If you are expecting some gourmet biscotti you will be disappointed. If you don't know the difference between cookies and biscotti they are not bad cookies, just sugary."
YUM!,5.0,"This was gift, that was much loved.....with coffee!"
Gift,5.0,They loved them. Will order again.
They were sooo delicious!!,5.0,"Gave as a gift which was shared on desert table after Xmas Eve dinner. Everyone enjoyed and wanted more, hahaha. Should’ve ordered two .I will next time!!"
They are addictive 😍,5.0,They are excellent.
Biscotti with toppings,3.0,"The biscotti was not very flavorable, just passable but the toppings were good."
Makes a very nice gift,5.0,Given as a gift the recipients were very happy.
Delicious Biscotti's,5.0,The Barnett's Biscotti's came wonderfully packaged. Each biscotti had its own little compartment in the sealed big box. The flavors were the same with assorted toppings. They were a thank you gift to an insurance agent who went above and beyond. They said the were quite delicious and helped easy the stress of an extremely busy office and insurance season. I would highly recommend them.
Bad experience and different taste,1.0,I am very disppointed about this product. I had big expectations since I had tried this brand before. Most of the toppings were on the paper. You could see that the package of the product was poorly made. You can see chocolate even outside the box. The taste was the worse part. It tasted old. It was not worth the price to pay for. I would not gift this at all. How do I get my money back? It is not worth it.
The product was stale,3.0,"I was very excited to send this as a Christmas gift to my parents after reviewing all the lovely pictures on Amazon. I am giving this a three-star. One star for how promptly it got there, another star for the presentation and the last star for the appearance. Unfortunately when they tasted them they were stale and inedible. It's important for this company to know this and should test their product before sending them out."
Not too good,1.0,"I chose this brand because of the 'festive' birthday wrapping - but next time I will go with the tried and true Nonnis biscotti.
These were more cake like and tasted stale - maybe it was just this box . . ."
Nice gift,4.0,The biscotti are nice a little softer than the biscotti I'm use to but they are tasty.
Biscotti....,5.0,"I ordered a box of biscotti for a friend and then ordered one for me to see how they tasted. I am so disappointed as there is no taste in any of them. They all tasted the same and had no flavor. I am embarrassed now sending them to my friend and her family. The reviews were good! Am I missing something? I payed good money for both and now stuck with only the bill. One star for the packaging as it was well done. I would like my money back!!!!!
UPDATE: Wow! What great customer service!!! I am being refunded for both boxes! Thank you very much! From the rest of the reviews, it sounds as though, many are very happy with this product."
Absolutely not presentable condition,2.0,"I ordered ""a nice box of pretty cookies with a Happy Birthday written on it"". The box came with damaged package all covered with crumbles from cookies. You would not want to receive a gift like that. And it's not returnable. So I had to open it myself since I couldn't use it as a gift. One cookie was broken, and overall, they didn't look as festive as the picture of them. Wasting money..."
Good Selection,5.0,Always a great gift choice. Can’t go wrong
Not what I expected,2.0,"Overall, the presentation is good. Biscotti cookies and box are attractive gift items. However, the flavor was flat and dry, and not what I expected. My mother and relates used to make biscotti, all of which had a nice, rich almond extract flavor. I might have also been spoiled after several trips to Italy. Honestly, I really wanted to like these but was disappointed, especially considering the cost!!! I will stick with high-end chocolates, like those from Vosges!"
Was a gift,4.0,"Was a gift so didn't taste. But family who received sent me picture of empty box a couple days later,so I assume good! Lol"
Delicious gift,5.0,"I bought these for a joint birthday bash with girlfriends. The packaging is so pretty - no need to wrap if a gift to be hand delivered. The biscotti were a nice assortment of flavors, delicious, and presented so beautifully with their different icings. I will order again."
"Delicious, Gourmet quality Sweet Delights! Reliable Top-notch Customer Service!",5.0,"This was purchased as a gift for my daughter. It was originally delivered during the hurricane/storm. The shipper damaged box and left it in my driveway. Barnette’s Biscotti’s handling of my problem was wonderful! There customer service is top notch! They immediately contacted me , apologized and sent me a new box of their delicious Biscotti. Their product is excellent quality! Fresh, exotic topped Biscotti. My daughter was thrilled! I intend to order from Barnetts for Holiday gift giving. They are a conscientious, reliable Company, whose product can’t be beat! Thank you Barnette’s i am so glad I found you!!!"
Very underwhelmed,2.0,"These cookies were small, cakey, and lacked the depth of flavor and texture found in ""Real"" Biscotti.
The chocolate was mediocre. My wife was disappointed.
So, I found a Biscotti cookbook and made a batch of Tuscan Biscotti with Italian flour, real orange zest, freshly ground nutmeg, and roasted my own almonds. The baking process of real Biscotti results in a far better texture.
The difference between these cookies and real Biscotti was astounding."
Several biscottis were broken.,3.0,Broken. Gave to staff at church.
Great as a Gift,5.0,These are delicious. I bought several of them to give as gifts. They come in a nice box with a ribbon.
Don’t buy!!,1.0,"It was not good quality, the chocolate is very greasy and it smears on your tongue , it doesn’t melt in your mouth, nevertheless it is overly sugary. I don’t recommend."
Delicious,5.0,Very fresh
Beautiful after initial package snafu-makes a great gif.,4.0,This was for an important teacher gift- presentation: Box was pretty with pretty bow- opened it up and 3 decorative biscotti were upside down and 1 broken- although there was a delayed response- they contacted me and replaced the box - it makes a lovely gift. I was originally disappointing with the upside down cookies- and I couldn't use it for a gift- the poor quality of packaging - that first order appeared to be a snafu and the next box was lovely - recipient was very excited.
gift family says good but taste dry,3.0,gift cookies were dry but ok
An embarrassing gift,1.0,I should have read the reviews more carefully. This was supposed to be a thank you gift. The biscotti was not crisp and most of them were broken. Thank you Amazon for crediting me for this disaster. The merchant should be ashamed.
Don't know,4.0,"I can not answer any of these questions. They were a present for someone, over 3,000 miles away from me. Never saw them."
These look much better than they taste...,3.0,"These biscotti look beautiful and have great toppings, but the cookie below is tasteless and is like eating sawdust. I was so looking forward to these, as I have become somewhat addicted to biscotti, specifically from Costco. I can’t really recommend these. We will probably throw the last few out. That tells you a lot in our hungry household."
The Presentation is Nice,5.0,They were more like decorated Sandie. Not the true texture of biscotti
Beautiful Presentation- would buy again,5.0,"Was a gift for my instructor. She said they were delicious. I saw the packaging, and it was very nice. I would purchase again. Perhaps for myself."
Surprisingly lack flavor,2.0,"I'm very disappointed with these biscotti. They got great reviews. I will concede that they look delicious and are very nicely boxed if you're thinking of gifting them. Unfortunately, the biscotti themselves are generally flavorless. Only two of the varieties had any taste at all. There is one with seeds where you can really taste the seeds and one with white chocolate and sprinkles that tasted good. None of the others tasted like anything. They are flavorless. I don't know how they've achieved this while putting chocolate and other toppings on them. Maybe it is the ratio of topping to flavorless cookie. The cookie part is the same across the board and completely lacks flavor. The only thing that varies is the topping. They are very disappointing."
"A Delicious ""Treat"" !",5.0,"I purchased these as a gift for myself!I enjoy these with my morning coffee!!They are packed in that beautiful box(I would have preferred if they were individually wrapped),you smell the ""goodness ""as soon as you open the box!Mine were in tact and none were broken or melted!I separated mine,by cutting the trays into three rows,and store them in a bread tin.They are crisp but not as hard or as large as some of the commercial ones I have had!The taste is delicious and you taste the quality!""You get hat you pay for!"""
"Okay, but presentation wasn't so great. Not very fresh tasting.",3.0,"This was for an early Mother's Day gift. The gift box looked nice, but the biscotti presentation after removing the plastic seal wasn't as nice as the picture. The biscotti looked dull in color and just didn't look or taste fresh. This biscotti tastes more like a Stella D'oro cookie than a biscotti. They were soft and nicely decorated, but the taste was kind of stale. Some of them were broken. Okay, I'll say it. I've had better boxed biscotti name brands that tasted better for less money. I don't recommend them."
Beautiful but not real biscotti,3.0,The biscotti was very beautiful when you open the pretty ribboned box and just for the look deserves five stars but when biting into the first one I was disappointed and that is for the lower score. The Italian cookie was soft and favor free. I love biscotti and love to bake them These were soft and not made for dipping and not tasty at all.
Inconsistent in size,3.0,I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend's birthday. He enjoyed the taste and said they were flavorful. It was however not as esthetically pleasing. The sizes were inconsistent and they looked like someone had eaten pieces off.
Biscotti,4.0,Flavor was ok but biscotti was too soft
Only give to people you don't like,1.0,"Got these for a family Thanksgiving, and they were stale and tastlest. After eating they made my wife ill. I want my money back."
They were a hit!,5.0,A birthday present for my MIL. She loved them!! Thank you!
Linda Carney,4.0,"As far as presentation goes.... on a scale of 1 to 10........it's a 15.
Box is a muted brown color...perfedt. and the bow is such a rich addition.
The graphic on the front is SO SOPHISTICATED. Wonder for a gift.
MOST of the biscotti's are really tasty.
There are just 2 that I tasted that could use more flavoring of some sort. Seem bland . Add vanilla or something.
My favorite is the chocolate mint. YUMMY!!!!!!!!!"
Mind blowing,5.0,Got this as a gift for 2 biscotti lovers. It blew their minds completely. They kept sneaking away to be able to grab another piece while we were still opening presents. These definitely won’t last very long. They can’t help but eat them so quickly. It has changed their view on biscotti by a lot. Store bought will never be the same again
"Not bad, but not my favorite",4.0,The biscuit was quite good. But some of the toppings I wasn’t a fan of.
Every Member of the Family Loves These Biscotti's with Coffee or Tea,5.0,"I have sent these Biscotti's Biscuits as occasional Gifts in the past, but this Year, I sent them to every member in the Family as our Christmas Gift to them from us. They have all called and said they loved them so much, they want to know how to purchase them again. The Barnett's Biscotti Cookies Gift Box is outstanding."
My new un-guilty pleasure!,5.0,"There wasn't anything I disliked about this product! As a matter of fact, I was given these as a birthday gift from my kids, and out of the goodness of my heart shared with my husband. He loved them as much as I did, so we ordered them and together we enjoy one each with our morning coffee! Love them!"
Great,5.0,My close friend has a gleuton alergy and finds it hard to find items she can tolerate. She told me this was over the top!
I thought they should be larger,3.0,"Decent flavors, nice variety. I felt they could have been fresher and larger in size, actually disappointed in the size. This was softer which I like. No I wouldn't buy this again."
Stale. Awful.,1.0,"These looked great, had good reviews, so I blew $40 on a craving. They're inedible. The quality of the biscotti itself - dry and crumbly. The various chocolate toppings taste like cheap chocolate. Beyond disappointing."
The box is beautiful and the cookies went over very well w my ...,4.0,"The box is beautiful and the cookies went over very well w my guests. My only criticism is that it was packaged in a way that placed it up too high in the cardboard box when it shipped. Since it wasn't bubblewrapped or put in styrofoam, when I cut along the tape on top to open it, I also cut into the box of cookies. I put a huge scratch along the surface, which kind of defeats the purpose of a pretty box."
Delicate cookie,5.0,Packed well.. cookie crumbles easily but arrived nicely packed
Packaging,5.0,"Update!
The product was awesome and they completely took care of the minor issue of packaging!
I would highly recommend these delicious biscottis which I have ordered a number if times.
Will keep ordering again!
Thank you!

The biscottis are delicious and that that is why I have purchased them so often."
Ok - Not Great.,3.0,"I bought this to send ahead of my arrival for the Christmas holiday. It got there just a few days before I did, so timing was perfect. Everyone was impressed and excited, however I was less than thrilled. The biscotti is very crumbly (easily crumbled), and therefore transportation alone had broken several up. The taste was ok - Not great. Chocolate and toppings were mouthwatering to look at, and unimpressive to eat.

I'm giving three stars because the product did part of it's main job - be a semi decadent food gift to ""show up"" with. It looked as Id hoped and people expressed as much... But I wouldn't buy it again and don't recommend it. I'll just pony up and go with Harry & David next time."
Favorite item to gift.,5.0,I like that it’s giftable. Chocolate is a winner and always arrive fresh.
Great gift!,5.0,mom and I loved our box. Nice selection of types and box is so pretty for a gift.
I liked the box and also the biscotti.,5.0,That was a birthday gift for my son and he liked it a lot.
Nice presentation!,4.0,"Thought these were good. My husband and I are big biscotti fans and bought them to take on a recent trip to have for breakfasts. They were all in one piece and definitely tasted fresh. We both preferred the ones with white chocolate. Our grandkids are enjoying the ones we didn’t finish on our trip. Not as good as homemade, but still tasty. This would make a nice gift."
"It's OK, but quite delicate.",3.0,"In my opinion, you're better off buying this sort of thing where you can pick it up in person. These things are quite delicate and do not hold up well to the rigors that most packages go through in shipping. I was disappointed giving these as a gift with several that were quite visibly broken. If I had it to do over again, I'd buy some good quality chocolates that aren't so susceptible to shipping damage. To be clear, my gripe is not with the product itself per se, just the fact that quite a few arrived resembling a pile of crumbs with no visible damage the the packaging. They tasted just fine though, so there's no worry there."
Always a great gift idea!,5.0,These biscotti are always fresh and tasty! I have sent them a few times for Christmas gifts.
No flavor skimpy toppings,1.0,My wife loves biscotti and it was our 35th anniversary. I was very disappointed and so was she.
The customer service has been awesome,5.0,"I would like to say that after a problem with my order, Customer service reached out with an excellent response and my replacement is a fresh and tasty delight that is quite lovely. 5 stars for both product and customer service. I am so please to seebusinesses that still care about their customers."
Deee-licious,5.0,Great gift
Excellent Choice,5.0,"I sent this as a gift to my son & daughter in law in Florida. They love good coffee and I thought this biscotti would be a very pleasant surprise for them to enjoy with their coffee.

I was spot on, as they lived it so much, I reordered another one right away.

They also had a tea party with their four young girls & they also got to enjoy it.

Excellent product.
Nicely packaged,(attractive & no breakage).
Fast shipping.

You will be very pleased to enjoy this for yourself, or to gift it to a loved one, or both!"
Half gone in one day!,5.0,"These were good....I mean REALLY good. I was actually pleased they weren't as hard and crunchy as other biscotti. They are more like a crumbly butter cookie (but still dipable in coffee). The flavor was amazing, not too sweet. And the toppings were all so yummy and fresh. I will definitely order again and I want to try the Oreos next. Highly recommend."
"Terrible, NOT what they show nor say it is",1.0,"Received this $50 item and it was terrible. The pieces of the biscotti were small, they did not even fill the individual compartments, they were soggy, melted, and uneatable. It says they are unreturnable. So I am stuck with a $50 package of terrible, biscotti that had to be TRASHED. NEVER AGAIN will I order anything from this company!"
Dry as a bone!,1.0,"Product was very dry and fragile as received. Easy to break removing from the box. Packaging was the best part of this purchase, not the flavor or freshness. Won't bother with them again."
Shipping that doesn't cause breakage of the biscuits.,4.0,"Enjoyed the Biscotti, recipe was new, refreshing and very impressive; I will order again & again.
Sent a second box as a thank you gift to a friend that I hadn't seen in over a year.
Unfortunately, most of the biscuits arrived broken in half. Fortunately, the enjoyment of the culinary delight was not effected by the breakage.
The box arrives gift wrapped so there is no need to add additional ""Amazon"" wrapping."
Tastes horrible,2.0,Was planning on using this for a bridal shower. They taste horrible.
Delicious!,5.0,Love these biscottis. Fresh and delicious!
"You get your money's worth, and they are very fresh.",5.0,I got this to bring to a Easter Brunch at my mother's house. Everyone was so impressed by the box and everything in the box was so pretty and delicious. It was more than I expected. Everything was so good you can't go wrong with this .
More cake-like than a traditional biscotti,3.0,These biscotti were more cake-like meaning soft and not crunchy like a traditional biscotti. They are not suitable for dunking in coffee as they will crumble immediately.
Expensive but worth every bite.,5.0,"So this is my 3rd time purchasing Biscottis cookies. They’re very delicious. They are so good that I bought them as a birthday present for myself. They’re not dry some other biscottis and they all are covered with chocolate and other treats on top of the chocolate like peppermint, peanuts and other toppings. I will definitely buy again. Love it!"
Fresh and Delicious!,5.0,This was a gift for my sisters birthday. It was beautifully wrapped in a gift box. Later we had some with our coffee and much to our delight they were so delicious! They were so fresh and the toppings were fun and creative. We had to restrain ourselves not to eat the whole box! Will definitely order again! Maybe just for myself this time!
Nice gift,5.0,Biscotti tasted good. Makes a nice gift.
You can't go wrong sending this gift for any occasion.,5.0,"I send this gift every Christmas, Easter, and Valentines to several family members. They have called me back telling me how delicious and fresh the biscottis tasted. My sister who works in a winery in Sonoma California said the presentation was fablous.
I will continue sending this gift."
Was not impressed with the biscotti will not order again,2.0,Biscotti is a hard cookie to enjoy with coffee and these were bland and not with a hard crust.
Beautiful gift,4.0,"These cookies came packaged beautifully and well done. Did not have breakage as reported in some reviews except one cookie which was nicely split in half. Would not have a problem serving these to guests. This confection is more of a cookie than biscotti. They are flaky, somewhat similar to shortbread in texture, rather than very crisp."
Best Sympathy gift-,5.0,We have ordered these before to send to people in times of mourning. Something sweet and decadent to easily share with visiting family. I highly recommend.
The are just OK,3.0,"They all taste the same. I guess with the different toppings, I thought they would taste different. The flavor is OK. I wouldn't purchase again."
great gift item,5.0,"I bought this as a gift for my Dad, and it was greatly appreciated."
No return/replacement policy. Kinda sucks!!!,2.0,"This was an Easter gift for my mom. It arrived crushed! The crumbles tasted good, but she was unable to use them to serve for her Easter dinner. Delivery should have been better! So disappointed!!!"
Always fresh,5.0,This is the 3rd time ordered and always fresh
Best biscotti cookies ever!,5.0,"we can't get enough of these, we have like 4 left in the box and have to order another but when the heat and humidity breaks up here because they will sit in the sun till one of us gets home."
Delicious biscottis,5.0,Gave them as a gift and the receipent said he really enjoyed them
Everyone loved them,5.0,Gift box was a beautiful display and everyone loved the biscotti. They were tasty and pretty.
Awesome customer service!,5.0,"Awesome gift! Barnett’s has amazing customer customer service. Although I had an issue with my initial order, they immediately resolved. Amazing service and amazing products. Thank you!"
Best Biscotti ever!!,5.0,"Elegant box and presentation, have bought every year for friends, coworkers and family with nothing but rave reviews 😊"
Did the job.,5.0,"One problem - my note was missing, so they didn't know who it was from."
Fantastic,5.0,Fantastic buy and wife and family absolutely enjoyed them.
Not worth it*,3.0,"UPDATED: after posting this review the owner refunded my box and provided quality service to make things correct. While I do not like these biscotti, the customer service was stellar.

These are about 1/3 the size of a normal biscotti. Cookie part is crumbly more than stiff and falls apart as soon as it gets wet. Overall, disappointed."
Really good bicotti!,5.0,Loved everything about these! Delicious and great variety.
Nice to give as a gift for any Occasion,5.0,"I am sure about teast and freshness of the product. But, I like the way of packing this up. Nice to give as a gift 🎁 for any occasion 😀. Thank you"
What to give a lady who stays in always.,5.0,She left bed it and of course it was a lasting treat.
biscotti,5.0,"thought it wasn't going to make it for Christmas, but arrived a week earlier....was sent as a gift........they were delicious.....!!!"
These cookies were wonderful,5.0,These cookies were wonderful
"Was not fresh, all the toppings were stuck to top inside box",2.0,"Was a Mother’s Day gift to my Mom, wasn’t fresh..all the toppings were stuck to top of the inside box"
Great,5.0,Efficiency and freshness
Gift box of Biscotti cookies,5.0,"The cookies looked wonderfully appetizing in the beautiful gift box. I sent them as a thank you gift to my favorite uncle
who has a mug of coffee in his hand everywhere he goes, naturally I chose the perfect compliment to enjoy with his coffee. I talked to him after the mail delivery to make sure they arrived as pictured. He assured me that they were beautifully intact. I also found out they were as tasty as they looked, so I am pleased with my purchase as this was my first time ordering this item from Amazon."
Great gift idea,5.0,"These were given as a gift, everyone loved them!!"
Nice Biscoti!,4.0,Biscotti's were good
They’re NOT super hard like most biscotti.,5.0,"OMGOSH! These are sooooo good! I bought them to give as a gift then thought, “I really shouldn’t give something I haven’t tasted” so...I received them today and had three 3!!!! with my coffee. They are really tender which is great for folks that can’t bite-down on hard food but didn’t fall apart in my coffee. That alone makes them perfect! The different toppings made me feel I was at a party. They are yummy, pretty and great tasting!"
Save your money- NOT impressed,3.0,"I'm no biscotti expert but these were lighter, smaller, and airier than I've had - these are not the twice baked brick hard dunkable versions. I think these would fall apart if dunked. Taste was more dried out cake than cookie."
Fast and of high quality,5.0,Gift
Biscotti at its best!,5.0,"My wife loves biscotti. I enjoy them, but not like her. I usually get her a box of her favorite candy for Christmas. I saw these when I was shopping online for some Christmas presents. I thought I would try them. Am I glad I did. She absolutely LOVED them. She has them with her morning coffee. I too have had a few with my coffee and think I am becoming a biscotti fan. The variety of flavors makes every one thoroughly enjoyable. If you like biscotti, or just want to try something different, then these biscotti will not disappoint."
My sister hid them......,5.0,They were so good she didn't want to share!!!!
Good,5.0,The candy was good
These treats don’t disappoint!!,5.0,Arrived on time and made a great holiday gift for my siblings!
Delicious not too sweet,5.0,Love it
Delicious,5.0,Great presentation and great flavor
AMAZING!,5.0,I bought this for my boyfriend for his Valentines present. He ate the whole thing in a day. I cannot believe how much he loved it! This was the first time I even heard of a biscotti and I must say I'm glad I found such an amazing gift for him. I can full heartily give 100% satisfaction on this present I got for him. The food could even be smelled through the wrapper and it was mouth watering. Much better then buying something from a store. It gave a more from the heart feeling to the idea of valentines!
Gift,5.0,It was a gift so I’m not sure how tasty it was
Great Biscotti,5.0,"I ordered these for a friend of mine recently diagnosed with breast cancer who was waiting to hear about her options. We ordered these to give her a little moral support while we were making our way to her, and to help take her mind off the wait. She and her family raved about them, and when she went to see her surgeon she shared them with them and the office raved about them.
It arrived on time, beautifully presented and a great box. I'm reordering them for my office today! Two thumbs up!"
Lacking a true biscotti “crunch”,4.0,"Although the toppings are great, the biscotti itself was a little lacking on the crunch factor. Unsure if it is the recipe or the freshness that contributes to that fact. It was an impressive gift though."
a gift,5.0,We sent this to a family member for Christmas. It was received 2 weeks before Christmas as I could not choose a later delivery date. The family opened it and called to say how much they are enjoying this. I will send this item again in the future.
The whole family Loved these,5.0,I reveived personal thank you from my nephews and sister 😍
Delicious 😋,4.0,Great for holidays loved it!!!🎁🥰 Perfect with coffee or tea..
A beautiful and tasty gift,5.0,I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and appearance of these biscotti.
Everyone loved this treat.,4.0,Made a great gift to my family
Gave as a gift,5.0,Gave it as a gift
It was a great gift.,5.0,The receiving party loved the gift.
NEED TO NOT BE SO CRUMBLY AND MORE FLAVORFUL,3.0,I LOVE BISCOTTI AND THIS LOOKED VERY GOOD BUT THEY WERE VERY CRUMBLY AND NOT AS FLAVORFUL AS I WAS EXPECTING. HAVE NOT TRIED THEM ALL YET THOUGH SO HOPE I WILL LIKE SOME OF THE OTHER ONES BETTER.
Not fresh,3.0,They weren’t like real biscotti at all. They were very dry and not dense and crunchy the way Biscotti should be. I was embarrassed to give this gift to my host.
Dry like cardboard,1.0,I ordered these for a birthday gift For my mother and when she got them she tasted them said they were dry like cardboard. I’m very disappointed in the product and disappointed that I can’t even get a refund or guarantee that if it’s replaced it will be better. Do not recommend and will not buy this again
Great gift!,5.0,Second time I’ve purchased as a gift and both times they loved them!
Too soft - this is more like a cookie,2.0,"I sent to my Mom for mothers day. Then decided to order for my wife. We received and were very pleased with the presentation and gift box packaging but very disappointed that these are more like dressed up cookies, not Biscotti. So, I called Dad and asked how Mother liked the gift and he indicated that she really didn't like them because of the texture. Overall, presentation was nice. I tried to like them but three of three that love biscotti said these just don't fit the bill."
Delicious,5.0,"Purchased as a father's day present. My parents like biscotti, and have a particular brand they prefer. However, they loved these and were extremely impressed with them. They said the toppings were great, but also that the biscotti cookie itself was very tasty and high-quality. They are pretty particular/picky in terms of what they like, and they were absolutely crazy about this."
Feel safe to try them,5.0,"My husband and I didn't like the biscotti, but you might. They are so beautiful and a good price, but for me, the cookie flavor was different from what I expected. HOWEVER, Barnetts refunded the money for the biscotti AND THEN sent a sample of their holiday cookies which are amazing!! The cookies are beautiful as well and will make a great gift. (as long as you can stay out of them!) LOL
We will order from this company again."
A Delicious Bite of Goodness,5.0,I received these delightful cookies as a gift and enjoyed them so much that I sent a box as a Christmas gift. These cookies are GREAT with coffee or without. They are fresh and flavorful. More cakelike than Italian biscotti but a delicious and flavorful. Enjoy!
Great,5.0,Great
I would consider these cookies…not tradition biscotti!,2.0,"I was excited to try these biscotti only to be very disappointed. They should be considered a cookie with different toppings…not a true Italian-type biscotti. Also, they came with many broken & didn’t taste all that fresh. Sadly for $40, they were not worth it."
Great gift!,5.0,Beautiful gift !
"Look Beautiful, Bland Taste",2.0,"The box and wrapping were gorgeous, and price quite high, so I expected a top notch product.

Bland in taste, more like a dry, flavorless cookie than biscotti.

4 of us tried them, sharing, to sample.

Very disappointing and quite overpriced.

Not at all what we expected."
Flavorful treat with coffee,5.0,"I liked the variety, size and price. Not hard and dried out and not too soft either. Loved them"
Very dissappointing - would never send as a gift for sure,1.0,"The pictures and description of these biscotti looked amazing. The packaging was very nice. But the overall product was very disappointing. Except for the fact that when you have chocolate and sugar coatings etc... it can't be that bad, there was nothing about these that were anything worth the price. It would be better to buy the regular almond ones from Costco and hand dip them in chocolate etc...and wrap them in a pretty box than spending the money for these. I thought when I got them I would have to make my family pace themselves to share but they have been at my house on my counter for weeks and no one chooses to eat them."
Total deliciousness,5.0,This was a gift for family. They loved it!
They were stale they were not fresh at all,1.0,They were not crunchy The flavor wasn’t bad it was just the texture of them that I could not handle
Just ok,3.0,"Based on the race reviews, I was pretty disappointed. They didn't live up to the rave reviews that I read."
Good stuff,5.0,"I bought these as part of a ""care package"" for a couple of pals; I'm told
""They are tasty. I would order them again.""
So, complete success :-)"
Absolutely Delicious,5.0,"I could smell the deliciousness before I opened the box! Unlike others, these biscotti are dry and crumbly without being teeth-breakingly hard. They're sweet, but not TOO sweet. Perfect for a cup of coffee! Really liked them!

Mine arrived with one or two broken, but that's no biggie! Those were the ones I ate first! :)

Very nice product. Will buy again."
The cake portion was not as firm as I would like it to be.,3.0,"The biscotti was too crumbly. It fell apart when handled and/or dipped into coffee. The chocolate coating held it together until dipped. The cake/biscotti part wasn't that tasty. It is not bad, just too loose of a texture."
Delicious and beautifully presented,5.0,"These biscotti are presented in a beautiful gold box and bow. The biscotti themselves are decorated beautifully and are delicious! If you are looking for an edible and memorable gift, you cannot go wrong with these. I sent about 15 to various friends and family for Easter and even received written thank you notes from several people exclaiming how special a gift these were."
Inconsistent sizes,3.0,"The size of the biscotti were not consisted , some were small, sone were fine ."
"Don’t buy, tasteless",1.0,Bought for Home consumption the pieces had little or no taste. Very crumbly don’t waste your money on this. VERY disappointed and too expensive for what I got. Probably won’t finish them. Birds or possums might get them
Not really impressed,3.0,Biscuits were too soft and not enough chocolate biscuits
It was a gift not for me,5.0,It was a gift and she liked it
That my relative liked the item.,5.0,A Gift to my relative at Christmas.
Good cookies,4.0,Cookies looked and tasted pretty good. I ordered them to use a part of a Christmas gift basket for family. The only negative thing was that about a third of them were broken when I received them. All in all I would order them again!!
"Handmade,fresh and fast! Perfect gift!",5.0,"Last minute gift needed for my mother in law's birthday (someone forgot to tell me,lol)! Scrolled through Amazon and found these amazing handmade biscotti's. Yes! Offered quick shipping and she was so happy, sent those pics immediately. Very professional and hassle free order process. Mom loved them, absolutely loved them! Thanks for making her birthday special 💗"
Birthday Gift,5.0,The person I bought them for said he liked the way they tasted. I didn’t try any of them.
Very pretty presentation in gift box,4.0,Very nice assortment and tasty!
Tasty but overpriced,3.0,"The toppings on the biscotti are excellent. The cookie itself is plain and could use some almonds in the mix. The box and total presentation of the product is well done. The biscotti are small in size and forty dollars for two dozen, to me,seems to be overpriced. The price is the main reason I would hesitate in purchasing the product again."
Absolutely amazing!,5.0,These cookies were absolutely amazing! We ordered over 29 boxes and they all were delivered within 3 days of my order. We used them as an Italian themed treat for our offices and they loved them! There were so many delicious flavors to choose from. What we loved most was that you could definitely enjoy a cookie with your coffee(like it’s traditionally done) but the cookies were fresh enough for us to enjoy them by themselves as well. I highly recommend these!
Not As Expected,3.0,"Great Packaging, but I did not like the quality of the product. Very sweet - too sweet for my liking. A lot going on topping wise. The only flavor I tasted was sugar...Only ate about 3 of them and discarded the rest."
Gift,5.0,Given as a gift. Unable to review.
It was a gift and a great surprise. Thanks for teaming with Barrnett!,5.0,A Christmas gift. My sister loved getting this.
Great Gift Idea,5.0,Bought this for my Mom on her b-day. She loved them. Checking my emails a few days later and i noticed i had a message from Barnetts. It was the owner. She told me thank you for my purchase and more importantly for being one of her customers. That folks is the difference between good and great.
"Great gift, very nice packaging and taste delicious!",5.0,"Highly recommend. Bought these for holiday gifts for a number of people, all of them loved them. Large nicely packaged box with a nice story about the company. Delicious biscotti that travel pretty well. Go well with coffee. Make a nice gift!"
Great assortment!,5.0,Great assortment and well boxed.
Messy,3.0,"The box looks good, but it's not presentable after opening the box. It's good that they have a clear plastic wrap sealed so the crumbs won't come out of the box when opening, but it looks very messy. It does not look pretty/presentable the way it looks in the photo. Good thing that I had it delivered to me first. I will need to clean/tidy it up before gifting them away. I would not recommend you sending this item to someone as a gift."
Great gift!,5.0,"Was a gift for a client that became a new mom. I put it in a DIY Gift basket. She loved them, said they were very fresh and tasted amazing!"
Biscotti Cookies Gift Basket,4.0,"Took several days to get here, so a little bit lower rating on the freshness but still a great purchase."
Was gift. They really liked the gift,5.0,The product was a Birthday gift for son and daughter in law.itwas packaged so beautifully.
Delicious,5.0,A birthday gift
Beware,2.0,"Be very careful—these are biscotti COOKIES, not biscotti! There’s a BIG difference. Very dissapointed."
Flavor,4.0,"They liked it a lot, so I bought two more boxes. However it is more like a cookie crunch not a true biscotti crunch"
"Blah, arrived crumbled. Tried a few, bound for the trash.",1.0,So glad I didn’t buy this to give as a gift. I had wanted to bring this to snack on with our morning coffee during a holiday weekend. It’s being tossed in the trash at this point. Don’t waste your money.
They were given to a 95 year old woman and she loved them,5.0,Great item !!!!
Great gift .,5.0,My girlfriend seemed to enjoy it.
Flavor very bland.,1.0,Flavor very bland
Very attractive & tasty!,5.0,"I bought as a gift & 1 for me as well. Several were broken when I opened it.
I was not sure if it was real fresh so I put it in the freezer to keep it firmer.
Taste was very good."
Delicious,5.0,My friend needed something small for breakfast after surgery
Very disappointed,3.0,The item looked beautiful but the taste left a lot to be desired. No taste at all. Very disappointed it was a gift to my husband.
Perfect gift,5.0,"I purchased these for myself, I love biscotti. They are moist, fresh, and delicious. I think they make a perfect gift for any occasion"
Who the sender was ?????????,5.0,The flavor and freshness of the biscotti was top notch. The packaging was very nicely done. I just wish I knew who sent them to me. It would be appropriate to send a thank you note. Kimberley Wolf
Wonderful gift,4.0,Given as a thank you gift and recipient was delighted.
Not fresh,1.0,"I sent this as a gift and while the product looked just like the picture, the recipient of the gift said that it wasn’t fresh at all with no taste. It’s unfortunate because these were expensive and wish I sent something from a local bakery. Don’t waste your money."
Nice presentation and very giftable,5.0,A different gift but very welcome according to the recipient
Not happy at all!!!,1.0,"I got the 12 piece box today, they where melted and tasted stale!!! I'm very disappointed as I got them for a gift for my husband. They are also a lot smaller then they show in the pictures. Was going to get the 24 box I'm very glad I didn't."
Delicious,5.0,Loved the flavors.
Unique gift!,5.0,Sent the Birthday box to our daughter. She enjoyed it! Fun and unique gift!
Excellent experience,5.0,They showed up quickly and were so good and worth the price that i purchased 2 more for my sons for fathers' day...and recommended on a facebook inquiry.
Got it.,4.0,Just got it. Looks good but one is missing.
Gift Box Damaged,3.0,"This is a gift. Why send a box that is damaged? Not able to open and see if the biscottis are damaged, but they sound like they are intact. I will let you know how they test."
"Melted, messy, damaged box, not giftable",1.0,"Taste and assortment were nice. Box came damaged, tops were melted. Could not use as gift. Ordered a second time, tops were melted, messy, used fingers to scoop up toppings once removing biscotti from box. Delicious, but I would not order again."
Constantly asked to rate it,2.0,Gifted to in-laws. None of them said it was good or tasty. None said it was bad. Will not be gifting this again.
A Little Disappointed,3.0,"One of the cookies was misshapen and oddly sized, about 2/3 the size of the others. I was a little disappointed. They could have been fresher, as well."
Beauty Is Only on the Surface,3.0,"The package was received in perfect condition, and the biscotti were very attractively decorated. The flavor of the pastry part itself was rather bland, though, and had a soft gritty texture that dissolved too quickly. This leaves more of the biscotti behind in the cup than usual. We trashed our box, but maybe you enjoy biscotti with this texture."
Each one is fresh and tastes great!,5.0,"I bought this as a gift for my friend who loves to have Biscotti with her coffee every morning. She loved these so much I get them for her every year now and she also buys them for her friends!
Each is individually wrapped and fresh when you open it to have it as a dessert or something sweet to dip in your coffee"
Little pricey but very tasty!,4.0,Particularly like to dunk these in my coffee. Very tasty and nice variety. Just wish it cost a little less.
A really nice gift,5.0,I bought these for Mother’s Day! My mother-in-law loved them. They were super fresh and the packaging was nice. Will definitely order these again!
Package flavor and on time,4.0,Flavor and packaging
Too soft to dip in coffee. Bland flavor,2.0,Not a biscotti...way too 'bready' and soft for coffee dipping. Neads a good firm crunch and better flavor.
don't buy,1.0,Very dissapointed with the quality...
Buenos,5.0,Sabrosas
Not biscotti - more like tasteless shortbread cookies!,1.0,"The ones I get at Costco or Walmart are way better - these taste like crumbly shortbread cookies and the toppings have no taste at all. They look REALLY tempting in the pictures, and even presentation-wise, they are not bad - the box is pretty, etc. But most of them were broken in two, and the taste is blaaah!! I like biscotti to be firm, so when dipping it into tea or coffee, it soaks up the liquid and tastes all crumbly after biting. These are crumbly to begin with, and don't soak up anything, and don't taste like much. Very expensive and very disappointing. Do not BUY!"
Better than fowers!,5.0,This was for my sister whom never had any kids of her own so it was a Mother day thanks. She love it; better than flowers she said😁
Nice presentation,5.0,Presentation gift wrapped
Great taste and shipped very fresh .,5.0,"Sent it as a gift to my daughter and boyfriend who were getting over Covid. They loved them , they were fresh, tasted great and they even ask for more . I’d order them again in a heartbeat!"

Nice treat for coffee lover,5.0,This was a component in a gift basket for a coffee lover. They were fresh and well received.
Won’t purchase again,2.0,Food in between the wrapping and box. Didn’t wasn’t to gift this way. Ended up opening since I couldn’t return. I think I’ll just make them myself next time
Came stale broken,1.0,Stale and broken
Item came quickly,5.0,We're very tasty
Outstanding Coffee Dunker,5.0,It comes in a beautiful box. The biscotti is very tasty with different toppings. Great to have on hand if you need a dessert. Have been ordering them for about a year now. Definitely could be sent as a gift.
Quality and freshness remains consistent,5.0,I received this delicious product as a get well gift from a friend in Ohio last year and said thank you a wonderful neighbor in Tennessee who cared for my cats recently by sending a box to their house.
It was the 2nd year of giving this to my grandson for Xmas. He loves them!,5.0,No
arrived melted huge mess not packed in dry ice!,1.0,Horrible arrived melted not packed for shipping in hot temperatures I tossed it out a big mush pile. I’d like a refund these weren’t inexpensive very annoying and disappointing you would think Italians would deliver a quality product! Big fail!
delivery prompt,4.0,I purchased this as a christmas gift. The idea of Biscottis sounded like a good idea because the family drinks coffee and tea and it is less sugar than cookies. Thank you for having this product.
Too soft,1.0,"I was so disappointed that I threw them in the trash. They tasted stale, too soft that they fell apart and when I received them all the icing was stuck on the paper. I guess I didn’t read that they were not individually wrapped."
Not for gifting,4.0,These are ok and very overpriced. Interesting varieties. Box was powdery and beat up. You won't gift it. I wouldn't buy again
Cookies,4.0,These are great cookies if you like butter cookie with awesome toppings. It makes for a great gift anytime.
W O N D E R F U L ! !,5.0,"Beyond fresh, it was amazing"
Yumm yumm,5.0,"This was a gift for my mom, she said they brought back childhood memories earing these same treats at grandma's house, she said they were deelicious.."
Delicious,5.0,"I get these for my mom on special occasions, she absolutely looks forward to her delivery."
It was very good,5.0,It was very good
Stale,1.0,I am so very disappointed. I was looking forward to this delivery. These are stale and old. They should not be sold. The toppings are so old the peppermint is gooey. So much to say but the seller is wrong for thinking its better to sell us old product so they don't lose money.
Best I've had!,5.0,These biscotti were delivered as promised and are the most delicious I've ever had! So fresh and flavorful! I wouldn't hesitate to order again for my family or as a gift!
Crowd pleaser,4.0,"Nicely presented, none broken on arrival. Fresh and crisp. These are not like the rock hard biscotti that are everywhere, these stand up to dunking and you don’t Beltran a tooth when you bite them."

Not worth the money!,3.0,"So disappointing!
Crumbly, dry biscotti under a tissue-thin layer of frosting or topping.
I wish I could return it."
Wonderful,5.0,Everything was wonderful
Very fresh!,5.0,Freshness
Nothing Great,2.0,These were nothing better than just okay. Not really worth the price. Costco's biscotti are better and much less expensive.
"Broken pieces, melted but replaced!!!",5.0,"Beautiful display but almost half of the pieces were broken. Also, delivered in the heat and about 20 % had begun to melt. Quality was good nonetheless. Subsequently, very surprised to receive a personal email expressing concern and offering a FREE replacement. Did not see that coming. Arrived today with another personal handwritten note from the Barnett family rep, Adley. Can't get much better than that."

DIsliked the product.,1.0,I was Not happy with this product. Dislike this product. not much flavor at all. The pieces were much smaller than. Not worth the price.
Way too much $$$,3.0,These were disappointing and definitely not worth the premium price that they have. Flavor wise they are not better than tbe ones you can get at sams club for much less money. Yes they do have a better texture but not enough to justify the price.
Enjoyable and tasty.,5.0,I had small issue with first batch of biscotti and the company went to great lengths to accommodate me by sending me another box of biscotti. Very tasty and fresh! Many thanks to Adley!
Perfect and delicious mothers day present,5.0,"My mother loves dipping biscotti in her coffee in the morning, and when I saw these on Amazon I knew they would make a perfect gift for her.

Beautiful and delicious. Would purchase again."
Not worth the money I paid.,3.0,"The biscotti was fresh and tasty, but I don't think they were worth what I paid."
Old,1.0,"Very Pretty. But super Dry. Flavorless. Super expensive disappointment for myself and my daughter , sharing a birthday. Sad. Desperate for happiness. Ripped off. Old crusty pretty crap"
Not received in giftable,2.0,Although these are tasty they are more like crumbly cookies than biscotti. When dunked in tea they fell apart. The box was shipped in a plastic envelope with no padding. The box was broken and cookies broken and crumbled. The toppings had fallen off and the cookies were covered with crumbs. Definitely not good enough appearance for gifting.

Great!,5.0,"The box I originally got had a very unpleasant taste, I think they were an issue with a batch as many reviews stated the same issue. However they reached out to me, refunded me and got me a brand new box as an apology. The new ones taste great! I am really happy with their customer service."
Excellent Quality!,5.0,"Our family enjoyed these biscotti cookies. I liked that they were very tasty and not too hard to bite into, like others I have tried. I recently started drinking coffee; and I don't use cream. Instead I just like dipping these cookies in my coffee. What's nice is they don't crumble when I do that. I also like the variety of biscotti cookies that I received."

Great gift and delicious!!,5.0,"I bought these for my boyfriend as a little something extra for our anniversary. To say he loved them would be an understatement! He was impressed with all of the different flavors and it didnt take long for them to disappear (into his belly). They came in a nice box with a bow, and not a single one was broken. I recommend this as a gift for anyone who likes biscotti."
Delicious,5.0,Teste great! Not extremely sweet like other products.
Very Poor Quality,1.0,"These cookies were very stale and extremely poor quality. For the price, I was expecting exceptional quality. My kids and grandkids all took one bite and wanted no more...then, to top it off, I went to my Amazon webpage, expecting to be able to return the item, but was informed, ""this product unavailable for return."" All in all, a very disappointing purchase...and for Mothers Day, no less."

Wet and mushy biscotti ! Amazons response… tough.,1.0,"This Biscotti was mushy and wet ! Since crisp texture is really the best part of biscotti , it forces me to say that this is the worst biscotti I have ever tasted or tried unsuccessfully to swallow !"
Poor product😪,1.0,The photos were attractable but when arrived it was very dry and not tasty.very disapointing

Absolutely terrible.,1.0,This product had an expired date on it. The box was busted. The chocolates looked to be unbeatable. And the said it is not eligible for a return. Prety much sent me 40.00 worth of crap and told .e i had to keep it
Don't buy food especially chocolate online,3.0,Don't buy food especially chocolate online
A great Mothers day item,5.0,"My wife is does not have a very big sweet tooth, so I had to find an item that was not overly sweet or rich. She absolutely loves these biscotti, and the variety is amazing. Each one is unique, and each one is delicious. Definently going to be getting again, if not for a gift, then just to have as a snack or nice desert!"
Average biscotti not worth the high price,2.0,"Nonni's biscotti available at most supermarkets is a better tasting product at a much more favorable price. Other than the gift box presentation, there is nothing special about these biscotti."

Yummy !,5.0,Came in great shape - perfect gift for coffee lovers !
"As good as "" home-made""",5.0,"Being of Italian heritage I was leary of sending any Biscotti that wasn't ""home made"", but the timing for my Uncle's birthday was near and the reviews were encouraging so I took a chance. My Aunt called to say she could not believe how beautiful and delicious the biscotti were,and how happy my uncle was with the gift. ""Brava"" Barnett's...great product."

Just ok,3.0,"The package looked really pretty when it arrived. The presentation is perfect. I wish I could say the same about what was inside. The biscottis were just okay, definitely not worth the price. Mind you - there's nothing wrong with them. But I have had far better tasting biscottis at less tan half the price."
Presentation is great!,5.0,They are so good…
Good presentation.,3.0,Just too bland in taste.

Great tasting gift,5.0,No dislike on this item or the delivery…all good!
Ok,2.0,I didn’t like the biscuit. It seemed like it was made of shortbread. The biscotti I usually get are firmer so you can dip them in coffee.
Fresh and on time,5.0,It was a gift and was well received
Not recommended,2.0,The cookies came broken. They had very little taste. I had store bought biscotti that tasted better.
Good for sharing,5.0,Bought this for a second year in a row and the family loves it for a Christmas surprise. It’s a nice large size to share.
Worse than BAD!,1.0,"These biscotti were neither “ too soft” or “too hard”, they were simply INEDIBLE!!! Once bitten into, the entire cookie crumbled into a pile of fine sawdust! Unfortunately, this deplorable state permeated the entire box! I don’t know if the problem was due to a faulty batch, or if they were mishandled after shipping, but I do know it’s an expensive gamble to take, on an item that is NON- returnable!!"
Best biscotti I've ever tasted!,5.0,"Delicious! They are so flavorful, buttery, and has a nice crunch where you dont feel like your teeth will fall out. Best of all, they arrived quickly!"
Great gift idea!!!,5.0,"I got this for my wife for Mother's Day and she loved it. It came in a nice wrapped with a bow. I was worried about the delicacy of the product but Amazon did a great job of delivering it. Nothing was broken. But more importantly, the taste was outstanding. Will definitely purchase again."
To dry,2.0,"Presentation was impressive and a nice arrangement of the biscotti . But when you bit into it, it fell apart. Giving no chance to dunk into your coffee or tea. They were dry, I don't if they were stale or that's how they are to be."
Delicious,4.0,"Deliciousness? Oh yes! The best. Presentation? Oh no, .....don't gift. At least not if yours is shipped. Most were broken up."

Simply the BEST,5.0,"I love biscotti but it is so hard to find really good flavorful biscotti that does not break your teeth!! I took a chance and sent to a friend who just raved, so I bought a box, arrived today and wow just wow, what great biscotti. Customer for life!!!!"
these are the worst bascotti in 50 years-sent me a new box and they are excellent THANKS,5.0,"The cookies were falling apart- As some from a family -had a few bascotti- it must have been from last years.
Terrible- tHEY REACTED AND RESOLVED IN A TIMELY MANNER THANKS"
They are very tasty,5.0,"So delicious! I ordered one box for a sister living in a different sttate and one for my household. That way she and I could both eat them with our coffee on Christmas morning, while we spoke on the phone together. It was my way of being with her. These biscotti were so good. And they are very decorative, too!"
So much better than anything you can buy at the grocery store!,5.0,"It was a gift for my birthday. I have made my own biscotti. It was very good, but I have to admit, Barnetts is even better!"
Won’t buy again.,2.0,I bought this for myself and a gift. Cookie crumbs everywhere covering the pieces. This is more of a cookie than a biscotti.
Yummy!,5.0,This was a gift and the recipients raved

Like Being Back with Grandma,5.0,"What a memory! I received these for my birthday. What a treat. I sat down and had these alone with a cup of hot cocoa and it was like being back at the kitchen table with Grandma seventy years ago. She dunk biscotti in her coffee and me in my cocoa over stories about the ""old country"".Thanks for the memories."
ok not fresh,4.0,"I like the taste varieties, and nice package- but not fresh and many cookies were broken"
Delicious biscotti,5.0,"Our biscotti arrived fast, secure and fresh. I bought for a Father's Day gift. My husband loved all the different flavors. Amazing. Arrived in a very lovely box"
Beautiful presentation,4.0,Beautiful looking presentation but flavor was so so.
Good variety and tasty.,5.0,"Bought this as a gift for my wife and she really likes them all, there was not one that she did not like. I tried a couple of them and also liked them. The package came with a good variety of flavors so you do not get tired of them."
Many of the items arrived broken.,2.0,"Biscotti arrived in pieces. Shipping probably the cause. Items were ok, but I would not order again. Small in size."
Highly Recommended,5.0,I bought this for my Mom for her 80th birthday. She received the biscotti the next day and raved about how fresh and delicious they were. Highly recommend.
NOT BISCOTTI: false advertising,1.0,"I received Biscotti last night and was excited to try. Not biscotti, but non sweet, bland cookie. My husband and I were left with unpleasant taste we could not get rid of. Three hours later I had terrible nausea. I had to take sodium bicarbonate. We threw out the entire box of 24 biscotti because they were so bad. False advertising. My husband is from Italy and these were not biscotti by any stretch. I should get money back like I would if I purchased it in a store."
Fresh Biscotti in a Beautiful Box!,5.0,"Wow! The ""freshness"" of this product is amazing. I've placed 3 orders in 6 weeks and...not sharing.
Thank you, Adley! Delivery on ice worked & the chocolate biscotti was beautiful and so good."
Recipient loved them,5.0,The recipient loved the cookies. They are delicious. Delivery was right on time and packaging is attractive.
Superb biscotti,5.0,"Superb product!!! Bought this for my wife on Valentine’s Day (something a little less traditional than chocolate and flowers) and it was a hit!!!! The pastries are finely crafted...delicate, visually pleasing and, best of all, very tasty!!! My wife tells me I make very good biscotti but I’ll admit that these are better."
NOT AS NICE AS THE PHOTO,2.0,"The description sounds decadent. But the cookies are small, they crumble and don't stay whole and they are not secure enough for mailing. They came melted. They are like mini biscottis. Too much money for what they are."
Wouldn't really call them biscotti,2.0,The box and presentation was very nice however I would not call these true biscotti...Shortbread at best. 6 were broken on arrival and they easily break when you try to remove them from the box...
Awesome Gift!,5.0,"My sister stated they arrived in great shape & taste delicious!

Good Birthday & Valentine Gift!"
very good,5.0,quality
They're Okay,3.0,These are okay. I wasn't wowed by them. The packaging they come in is not conducive for storage and I don't care for many of the flavors. There were a couple that were quite tasty but $30 is a bit much (in my opinion) to spend for maybe 6 biscotti. I would say they'd be a nice teacher's gift but the packaging is thin and really flimsy.
Worth money and delicious,5.0,Worth money and delicious
Great gift to send,5.0,This was a gift I have delivered. It got RAVE reviews from the folks I sent it to
Thanks for letting me find this youmie 🍯 idem,5.0,Very very pleased 😀 will sertnely buy again
Not very good,2.0,"Bought as an anniversary gift for my in- laws. So... from looking at the picture and based on the cost, I was expecting these to be good. They weren't. They just didn't taste good. They look pretty and the presentation is nice, but that's all. Would not recommend."
Incredibly Tasteless,1.0,"If you know and love what biscotti are supposed to taste like, skip these and go to your local Italian bakery for your gift idea. These biscotti taste stale. I am confounded as to how the toppings can be so flavorless. I mean seriously, how did they make chocolate have no flavor? How do you even make peppermint that barely registers any taste? Other reviewers have said the same thing. Read the lower star reviews before you purchase.

Update - they did offer a refund after reading this review, so at least customer service is decent. I can't see how to answer their message to me, so maybe they will see this update. Thanks."
Delicious gift!,5.0,I gave these to my Dad this morning for Father’s Day and he couldn’t get over how delicious they smelled even though they were still wrapped. He loved them and will be enjoying them immensely. Turned out to be a great gift for the man that doesn’t really need anything.
Gift for my mom,5.0,My mom loves her gift.
These cookies were AWFUL!!,1.0,"Several of these were broken when they arrived, but I can understand how that could happen. However; 2 of the cookies did not have the other half. They were stale and tasteless. One of the flavors had a fishy taste. Horrible. They went into the garbage. Perhaps the company should review their quality control. It has occurred to me we may have gotten a bad box, but for that kind of money I am not willing to take a chance."
I would not purchase again,1.0,These are NOT biscotti. So i was very disappointed. They are biscotti-shaped cookies. Not worth the high price.
Excellent,5.0,"i have gifted these 3 times, all
to rave reviews. Especially good with coffee"
Birthday treat,5.0,I bought this as a Birthday treat for my Pastor and he absolutely loved it!! I'm going to purchase another one soon for myself! I recommend this treat for everyone! Yummy!!
My Folks Loved These,5.0,My folks that are basically shut in due to the COVID pandemic. They loved receiving these and ate them all rather quickly. They enjoyed them... :)
They are fresh,5.0,I love it ! My husband and I enjoy every single night with our coffee ! Delicate flavor .
Absolutely delicious,5.0,"What a great gift, they are fabulous and look so beautiful in the box as well as tasting good. Would highly recommend this product."
Disappointing texture and taste.,2.0,Disappointing texture and taste. Pretty box and ribbon but that is not enough to make up for pure product. Grocery store biscotti are superior.
Meh...,2.0,Bought these as a gift for my husband. Took us almost a month to finish them. Not the greatest.
A good gift for anyone .,4.0,Well package not one cookie broken beautiful presentation.
Really Appreciated by Recipients,5.0,"I gifted three different families plus my building manager with these biscotti, and all were
very pleased."

Thank you."
Cookie on bottom with candy on top,5.0,I bought this for my mother; she said they were great.
Nowhere near a biscotti!,2.0,They’re not awful but they’re nowhere near what a biscotti should taste like. The texture is all wrong. These are just cookies covered in chocolate! I ended up throwing away more than half the box.
Very good and nice present,4.0,Sent as a gift to my daughter and roommates who are in college. They said the biscotti were very good and arrived on time.
Excellent product,5.0,I bought this item to give as a Christmas gift. The biscotti are excellent and the container is also very nice to give as a gift. Sometimes biscotti can be dry and mealy. These were very tasty and were enjoyed by the staff. I would definitely buy this product again.
Not What I expected,2.0,"1. No description inside for what each bicuit is.
2. Definitely lacks tast and freshness."
Great product,5.0,This was a mother’s day gift - the presentation was beautiful and my mom loved it. She also liked that they were easy to chew! (Haha) my dad got to them after my mom and promptly ate the rest of the box - I know what I’m ordering for Father’s Day!
They were slightly melted. But the cookie was soft. No crunchy like a regular biscotti.,1.0,This was a gift for my sister.
Delightful,4.0,The texture was soft and delightful. It would be nice to have a plain biscotti included as well.
The flavor of these was very good; however,4.0,"My husband got these for me on Valentine's Day. The flavor of these was very good; however, I like mine a lot more crunchy."
Great gift,5.0,Very much a great gift idea...they were super fresh and delicious
NOT A Biscotti. Just a cookie.,1.0,"Very disappointed with my purchase of Barnetts Biscotti. I was expecting a Biscotti as advertised, but I got a box of very expensive cookies! Bought these as a gift for a friend who loves Biscotti and when we both sampled them, we were extremely disappointed. They are soft in texture, just like a cookie. Wish I could return, as I feel a little cheated. Don't normally write reviews unless I have something nice to say, but I felt compelled to write this one."
presentation was nice,3.0,Presentation nice
Perfect in every way!!!!,5.0,"Bought these as a Christmas gift for my sister who is VERY picky. She LOVED them!!!! Could not stop raving about how awesome they were!! Highly recommend anyone who likes a good biscotti buy these now!!!
Arrived as promised in an elegant box."
Very odd texture.,2.0,"Maybe the biscotti that I got were old, but the texture was very dry and powdery - almost like compressed sawdust. The toppings were fairly nice but my wife and I decided that the flavor and texture of the cookie part was so unappealing that the biscotti weren't worth the calories and we threw them out."
Gourmet Biscotti,5.0,"This was purchased to give to a family member who loves biscotti. The package came carefully packaged and with a beautiful bow. I initially was a little disappointed because the biscotti were actually pretty small, about half the size of what I expected. However, with the variety the package offered, the recipient of this gift loved it. The size was perfect as a small treat, and the variety made the gift appealing. The biscotti was fresh and delicious."
very good,5.0,very good
Great gift!,5.0,Given as a gift. Great for a coffee lover.
Delioso y buena calidad,5.0,"Fue agradable y le gustó a la familia

Delicious variety pack!,5.0,"I ordered the biscotti pack for the Holidays. I loved the flavors and the biscotti was really nice, fresh and crumbly. I don’t like a biscotti too dry and hard so I really appreciated the texture. My Italian friend absolutely love them and couldn’t believe I found these on Amazon. I would definitely order these again for a special occasion. I must compliment the packaging as well with the golden paper tray and bow. It held up great all throughout the shipping process."

Delicious!,5.0,"The biscotti were wonderful. First of all, they look yummy and gorgeous in their packaging. Once you taste them you are not let down at all. They taste so good. You don't want to eat just one. I recommend Barnetts Biscotti for a nice gift or dessert for a party. They are great."
Two Thumbs Up!!!,5.0,"Amazingly these biscotti passed the taste test of the biggest ""PickyPuss"" I ever met....My Nephew!! One bite and his smile lit up, thumbs went up and even a ""Wow, these are really good...I think I'll try another."" flowed through his lips. I know where I'll be shopping for Christmas this year!!!

VERY DISSAPOINTING!,2.0,was very dissapointing. Hardly any chocolate so hardly any taste. Cookie fell apart. Definitely not worth the price. The only positive was the packaging. That was very impressive.
Great gift,4.0,This was a gift
Fresh and delicious,5.0,"Very fresh, and the variety is wonderful. Such a beautiful gift, too. Very happy."
Expensive but not very tasty.,2.0,These are advertised as biscotti but they are more like a thick cookie. Definitely not good for dunking as they are too light. They're crushed candy topping was pretty but not what I am looking for with my coffee. I would not purchased again.
A gift well received!,5.0,"I sent these a condolence gesture, which was very much appreciated
for it's taste as well."
Stale upon arrival,2.0,Ordered two sets and this one was definitely old. Many of the biscotti were broken inside the box and very stale. But toppings were rancid tasting. The other box ordered was perfect. Out 40.00 for inedible biscotti. Some of the earlier reviews mentioned the broken cookies and the problem with freshness. I should have listened.
Disappointed.,3.0,"I like the packaging but the biscotti were not hard and crunchy like I'm used to, all of them tasted alike and I would not purchase them again."
They came very quickly and were fresh:),4.0,"They were very tasty and when dipped in coffee, were satisfying! Loved the different flavors."
Horrible,1.0,Chocolate was melted all over so presentation was bad. Almost every biscotti was broken. I have tried several different ones. They are stale and of poor taste for the money spent. I would be embarrassed to serve these to friends.
Mediocre at best.,2.0,"I’d love to support local businesses, but these biscotti are mediocre at best. They’re just airy, crunchy, biscotti-shaped “cookies” with no flavor. The appearance when they arrived was kinda crappy compared to the website pix."

Cookies were broken,2.0,Ordered for self. Biscotti were broken
Good gift,4.0,My daughter like them
The order was fast and accurate,5.0,I give it to my wife for Valentine's They were pretty good
Very delicious!,5.0,"I had only one or two of the biscotti bars. I didn't get a chance to try all of them because I set them on the break-room area table at my work place, and they disappeared before I got a chance to try them all. Works very well with coffee."
Bought these for my father and he's still talking about them!,5.0,My 95yr old father just got out of the hospital after a bad fall and I sent him the box of biscotti. Not only did he love it but so has everyone that has come to visit him. I need to send him another box...

Cookie delight,5.0,Presentation and flavor are great almost a crime to dip them in coffee
WASTE OF MONEY!,1.0,"I got these as a gift, for my wife’s birthday, she loves biscotti ,but these are a poor excuse for gourmet!
These were STALE as heck and really they are a huge ripoff !! They are actually only half a biscotti.
Thats probably why you cant get a refund.I am beyond disappointed at this point, Don't waste your money.
Unless you like paying $5.00ea for stale cookies."
Attractively packaged great gift,5.0,"Package looks great. Box is well constructed, has a nice bow. I slid off bow to check contents which were sealed under plastic. Biscotti looked great nicely decorated and even through the tight plastic cover I could smell the fresh baked scent. Very pleased as this was a gift."
This was a gift,5.0,"Hello,
I waited to write my review because this order was a gift to a friend! She said they were great, so I may be purchasing for another friend who lives some distance from me. Keep up the good work!

Excellent,5.0,"The cookies are high quality, very flavorful and if they are being given as a gift they packaged in a elegant enough of a box all you need is a label. The ladies in my house loved them. I did to when I could sneak one away."
I bought these as a gift for Christmas,5.0,"The biscotti arrived quickly and the box was beautiful. These were a gift for Christmas, so I do not know how they looked inside or tasted.

LOOKS GREAT,2.0,"NOT FRESH. DRY AND TASTELESS. THIS WAS A GIFT. I HOPE FOR THE BEST,"

Perfect gift for snack lovers!,5.0,Delicious!!
Great Flavor and a Great Gift,5.0,I ordered these as a gift and the family couldn't be happier with the freshness and flavor. I was fortunate to sample them and now I'm sure I'll be ordering these again.
More Cookie than biscotti.,2.0,"This was not crunchy like a normal biscotti I am accustomed to. This had a good flavor but was more like the sweetness and softness of a cookie.
I would rather have had the cookie."
Softer than traditional Biscotti,2.0,"- Tasted stale, but still had a couple months before expiration
- Many cookies were broken
- Very crumbly cookie, not ideal for dipping into coffee"
Not very fresh or flavorful,1.0,"these were half the size as last years order and not as fresh or delicious
very disappointed, some were just slivers some partial pieces as seen in my pic. Terrible presentation I will not be putting these out for Christmas. I am going to be unhappy when my sister gets hers in a couple days now that I know the Quality is so pour.
Will not purchase again."
Great taste,5.0,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my mom. I live 1000 miles away. She sent me a picture, showing that she ate the whole first row when she got it. I would recommend this as a gift for anyone."

Lovely product and delicious,4.0,Purchased this as a gift and it was a hit.
JANET FROM WISCONSIN,5.0,"I AM 81 years old, and my children got me an account with amazon. When I saw Barnetts Biscotti, I decided to try them. When I opened the box, I was amazed at how beautiful it looked. My son took a picture of it, to show my family. The texture of the biscotti is great. I will definitely be ordering more Barnetts sweet creations!!"
Great gift,5.0,This was a gift and I was told it was delicious
Not crunchy,2.0,Gave as a gift to my parents. Was told they were not crunchy like a biscotti but more soft like a cookie
Amazingly delicious!!,5.0,I bought this to bring to my son's house for our Christmas dinner!! EVERYONE loved them. Their assortment is fabulous and they literally taste 'like butter'.....just melted in your mouth. Alone or with coffee or hot choc drink. I plan to place a second order..
Delicious!!!,5.0,I got this as a gift for my aunt and she loved them! The box was gone the same day. Her and my family enjoyed the biscuits early that morning with some coffee. This will be a yearly gift for her now.
Disappointing,1.0,I hoped these would be good but they are pretty terrible. The cookie part is all the same flavor with different things sprinkled on top. Each piece of biscotti is dipped in a coating kind of like candy melts. They didn't seem to be very fresh. I currently have 5 kids and 3 adults staying with me and this box of biscotti had been sitting on the counter for almost a week.
Fancy but not tasty,2.0,"Very fancy packaging, nice gift idea. BUT this are basically plain sugar cookies disguised as fancy biscotti. All the same kind of biscotti with different chocolate toppings that are equally similar in flavor to each other. There are many better biscotti with different combos of crunch, different nuts and fruit available. My favorite is Almondina Variety 6-pack with 6 distinctly different flavors (chocolate cherry, pistachio, cinnamon, sesame, etc), available on Amazon. Disappointed in this."
Amazing present 🎁,5.0,Got this for my Mom’s birthday and she absolutely loved them! I tried a couple and they were delicious!
Amazon took care of a problem,5.0,"Unfortunately because they were delivered in the hot weather - the toppings were stuck to the cover
I will definitely order them for gifts when the weather changes as I know they will be loved by many of my friends"
Package has great appeal and product as well.,5.0,The owner personally wrote to complete this survey. A classy company and a classic product. Best of both world's. Thanks to Barnett's and wishing you all the best in 2020. The Hummel's.
Delightful!,5.0,"I have given these Delightful Barnetts Gourmet Biscotti, as gifts this past Christmas, and got rave reviews about them, so much so that, I had to try them for myself. I Loved them. They are just the right size as to not feel guilty for treating yourself."
This was a gift and they LOVED it.,5.0,"This was purchased for a corporate person that is in another state, but is always super helpful. Couldn't do our jobs half as well without her. She said it was super delicious and she couldn't have asked for anything better."
MELTED,2.0,"These are great tasting, but they were mailed to me without any protection from the 100+ temp. and so they were melted! Too bad!"
Excellent choice,5.0,My husband like the large variety as well as the freshness.
Ummm...no,1.0,"I only ordered these because I wanted overnight by 8am shipping for another product that I NEEDED. I thought, great. Biscotti with my coffee. I eat everything, especially carbs. Not these. There is a very unusual taste that is not good. I tried the three pictured and they all had this taste. I can’t describe it. Not quite mold, not quite chemical. I checked the box and it’s marked 05/28/2021. Maybe it’s where they are warehoused, because some reviews are good. So, if you would get overnight and in Seattle area-avoid. And, no returns. I thought, I’m a Prime member and have always been able to return. Not these. The only good news is my dog likes them."
Happy in bklyn,5.0,"Great product.
Oh so fresh."
Delicious,5.0,Delicious and beautiful
"Stale, unpleasant flavor . Many broken.",2.0,"25% broken , that’s not a big deal...however the biscottis had an off ,stale flavor ... could almost be described as “rancid” - mouth and tongue coating ,very unpleasant. The box and presentation were nice, but I wouldn’t buy these again, nor recommend to friends and family."
Gift idea? No.,1.0,The box came with chocolate pieces that had rub all over the outside. I bought this as a gift but doesn't present well at all.
Highly Recommend,5.0,Sent to my Father for a Fathers Day goft and he loved them! Thank you for great customer experience and service!
Gift,3.0,Giftable
Not very giftavle for Mothers Day,1.0,"Broken cookies and tops of icing from cookies stuck to cover. Very disappointed when it’s suppose to make for a nice presentation for Mother’s Day, not a product I would recommend for purchasing."
Received Fast and Fresh,5.0,"The biscotti was received quickly, and was fresh and tasty! All biscotti were received in one piece and very pretty in my glass container at the coffee bar! No broken pieces."
Biscotti,3.0,They were beautifully boxed and appearance was beautiful. Was expecting a true biscotti. They were more like cookies.
Broken and melted,1.0,"I ordered this for my grandma and it arrived with most of the biscotti broken and or melted. I was really excited since she is so hard to buy a gift for, but she loves coffee and biscotti. Definitely won’t be trying them again."
Biscotti to die for!!,5.0,These biscotti were purchased for a family gathering. They present beautifully and taste as good as they look!

Delicious,5.0,The biscotti’s were very very good!
Great for gifting,5.0,Sent this as gift to three different families....they all raved about it!
Heaven in a Biscotti Gift Box,5.0,I had this gift sent to my aunt for Mothers Day and she dug right into them. She truly enjoyed it and commented specifically that it was real chocolate. LOL. I think she may have already finished them off.
A darn good biscotti,4.0,These bicotti are great tasting. They arrived in terrific condition.
na,3.0,na
These are NOT TRUE BISCOTTI!,1.0,"These are nothing more than frosted vanilla cookies. They ARE NOT IN ANY WAY BISCOTTI. The cookie is nothing more than frosted shortbread cookies with frosting. The crumble the instant you try to pick them up.

We ate 1/2 of one cookie and the rest are sitting on the kitchen island. Lol, maybe in time they will become hard, like Biscotti is supposed to be."
Cookies looked good but so stale. Like sawdust.,1.0,This was a gift. I am humiliated. Worst biscotti she ever had. She served them Christmas Eve and was embarrassed. Not one person took more than one bite. I’ve sent this item as gifts many many times over the years and never had one complaint until now. So stale that they looked and tasted like sawdust. I’m hopeful Amazon will make this right.
Disappointed in These,1.0,"Got these as a birthday present for my wife. Our box was a disappointment. My wife said the biscotti part was old and soft, not fresh and crisp as advertised. The tops of all the biscottis looked old and tired, not fresh looking at all. The chocolate dull looking, not fresh. My wife reported the taste as ""blah and boring"". Maybe we got a box that had been around for a couple of years instead of a fresh box. At any rate, it was a disappointment as a birthday gift. Returned for a refund."
It was great! I bought it for a friend and they ...,5.0,It was great! I bought it for a friend and they loved it! One or two did melt since it was in the sun and heat for a little while but they said they put it in the fridge and it was even better that way.
Taste great,5.0,Everyone loved them
Delicious/Scrumptious,5.0,I bought these as a thank you gift for my lawyer and his team. They loved the biscuits and are now asking where to get more! Thank you!
Great gift,5.0,Sent as a gift and they loved them.
Advise Against based on My Experience,1.0,"I bought the biscotti as a gift but kept it after I found another gift I liked better. I was surprised when I opened the biscotti to find 3 cookie slots with no product at all. Two other slots had cookies that were broken into pieces. Very few of the cookies were completely intact.

I'm so glad I did not give this to someone as a gift, that would have been embarrassing. Maybe I just got a bad batch or maybe it got banged up in shipping, but I would not recommend this product based upon my experience."
Best Biscotti!,5.0,DELISH!!!!!!!
nice cookies,5.0,"They are a nice size. Not to big, not to small. Just right. Good cookies. Great with my cup of tea or glass of milk before bed."

Yummy,5.0,Delicious!!!! Wonderful assortment and beautifully packaged.
Yummy biscotti’s!,5.0,They are soo good! I gave them as a gift for Valentines Day. The only suggestion I have is that when ordering a wide variety like I did. In the box should give a description and flavor of each biscotti.

Flavor.,2.0,"The biscotti was not what I would usually get. Chocolate, of course, was melted and some are broken."
For that Special Person -a little something,5.0,The cookies are amazing. But I must have done something wrong. I put in a different delivery address but cookies came to me. There is no way I can get these cookies to the intended party for Christmas! She loves these cookies. What did I do wrong?
It’s not biscotti.,1.0,"It’s shortbread. The chocolate didn’t taste right or have the crisp texture of dark chocolate. I think it may be Dipping Dots, or something. Packaging is deficient. It arrived with broken cookies, with parts of the chocolate and toppings broken off. Definitely not giftable. Save your money, and buy a bag of Oreos."
Great Product,5.0,"A special gift, that was thoroughly appreciated."
Fantastic snacks,5.0,Love these cookies. Reminds me of my past with my Italian relatives will take these out on the table after dinner to have with coffee or Italian coffee. I can’t recall the name. Excellent taste.
Not wrapped. Won’t hold in freshness. Disappointed for the price. Half the size of a biscotti.,2.0,I thought they would be wrapped better to save freshness. Soft not like biscotti. More a biscuit. Disappointed overall.
A WONDERFUL GIFT FOR A SICK FRIEND OR RELATIVE,5.0,"I have ordered this item many times for friends and relatives ane received many thanks from those who received them. They are not delivered as quickly as past items were, but still a great gift."

"All Taste The Same, Dry w/ Chocolate Topping",2.0,"Looks to be a nice assortment of multi-flavored cookies / biscuits , but they all taste exactly the same, and simply have a variation of the topping on them that is not robust enough to lend much added flavor to the bland cookies. Would not recommend unless you like dry average flavored cookies. Will not buy again."

Okay but I’ve had better,2.0,"I received the box and opened as it had a nice gift box and ribbon. It was totally sealed with plastic. Once I opened the plastic I saw a nice layout of the biscotti’s but saw that some of the biscottis were crumbling.

I received the two boxes I ordered. One was a gift and the other was one to sample. The box and look of the Biscotti cookies was very nice. Opened one box to try them, excited to try them and oh my god they were terrible. They tasted like soap. Disgusting. I feel ripped off, because they were not cheap.

The frosting on top were decorated beautifully, a little on the sweet side since the actual biscotti didn't have flavor all you could taste was the sugary frosting. It also fell apart very quickly once dipped in my cuppa coffee, so that wasn't very fun."

The biscotti are small - not like the huge ones at Starbucks. They each are embellished with different goodies and the taste was fantastic. So glad we got to see the presentation box and the products. We will continue to send this out for all occasions!"

Worst biscotti I've ever had,1.0,"This is not biscotti, it's more like stale old cake. It had no flavor, I was totally embarrassed to serve them. I've gotten better biscotti from Job lot. You should be ashamed of yourself for selling this garbage."
disappointed,1.0,the product was melted
Awful,1.0,"I received these as a gift and they are awful. They're covered in dust and taste like a pile of nothing. Looks good on the surface, but that's about it. I'm sad that the giver spent their hard-earned money on this item."

A Great House-Warming Present,5.0,I sent these to a friend that bought a new house. She and her son enjoyed the entire box over a weekend. She was quite impressed with how good they were. My only regret was not buying a box for myself. This will definitely be a go-to present again. I thought they were fairly priced as well.

Delicious,5.0,Great tasting as well as assortment definitely will buy again
Ok,5.0,Ok
Biscotti,5.0,Makes for a great gift.
poorly packaged,3.0,Everything is good … except that it was really poorly packaged. It was just shipped in a white thin Amazon plastic bag! The cookie box was badly damaged and looked like something from years ago. The top decoration of the cookie was a mess. And this is a gift … I am so disappointed and will not purchase again.
Sent as a gift,5.0,"I can’t believe how quickly these were delivered!
My friends loved them Thanks!!"
Great gift,5.0,My dr said they were delicious ! 😊
Marcia,3.0,Packaging was classy. Product display was very appealing. Variety was great! Flavor was ok. Freshness was too dry as some arrived broken. Priced too high for amount of product.
Gift well received,5.0,Sent as birthday gift. Would definitely send again for any occasion. Nice way to say you care and be confident in the gift quality
HORRIBLE! DO NOT BUY!,1.0,"Do NOT buy these. I know what biscotti tastes like because I make them. These were so dry, crumbled, no flavor and STALE. My daughter bought these for me for mother's day. She didn't know, not her fault! I wanted her to return them. We threw them away. Disgusting!
I don't know how anyone can give these 5 stars!"
Amazing!!!,5.0,I have sent this as a gift multiple times and every time the recipients have nothing but positive things to say overall! Highly recommended for sure!

These taste terrible.,1.0,"These taste terrible, only buy them for people you dislike. I could only eat half of one, I threw the rest out. (If you are reading this mom, I love you and I'm sorry.)"
Sent as a gift,3.0,Bought as a gift for my grandma. I sent it with a gift message to tell her happy birthday and that it was from me and her grandson. Apparently someone screwed up the message and they got someone else’s- my Gma called and told me it didn’t have my name on the gift message or anything close to the msg I sent. So they spent hours trying to figure out who the person was that sent it. Embarrassing. Giving three stars since I was told they were delicious.
Biscotti,3.0,The flavor of the biscotti was very good. But for some reason all but 3 were broken.
CRUMBS AND CHUNKS,1.0,Package left on door step not hand delivered no doorbell ring. This was supposed to be a birthday gift for my mother the package arrived in the evening and the biscotti‘s were in broken pieces more like crumbs and chunks.

Good but sent too early,4.0,I ordered this as a gift for my daughters office. I was told they were very good. I ordered them to be delivered on Wednesday when they were in the office. Unfortunately they were sent 3 days early USpS putting in a lock box. Fortunately on 5% had melted chocolate.
Great Gift for Family or Work,5.0,Beautifully presented and of high quality
They were great. Yum,5.0,They were great.
My fiancée is picky eater,1.0,My fiancée can taste the difference between cookies store in this manner and shipped online over home cook desserts so she didn’t like it. If you do not notice a taste between these cookies bought online and home made cookies then definitely buy it.
Gift arrived broken and stale,1.0,Sent as an Easter gift. Cookies were broken and stale.
Best gift ever would order again,5.0,Flavor and freshness are outstanding
On time and delicious!,5.0,On time and delicious
Could be a great gift but,3.0,"They look like they’d be presentable but so many of them looked damaged. The toppings were melted off/missing. This was a birthday gift
:("
Not the Italian Kind,3.0,"I am extremely disappointed with your so called Gourmet Chocolate Covered Biscotti.
The biscotti are dry but not crisply dry like a real biscotti should be, these are pretty tasteless, even with frosting.

Although, when contacting the company, I received a prompt and nice response, apology and a refund."
Christmas gift,5.0,Was a great Christmas gift
Delivered on time,5.0,Delivered on right time to the right address. Great product.
Just ok,3.0,I was super excited when this got delivered to as a gift but then when I never heard about it I got curious and asked how they liked it and was to be ok. Not hard and crunchy like biscotti but more like a dipped cookie so not so dippable in coffee. But flavors were good just not what was expected for biscotti overall.
Speedy shipping,5.0,Love
I gift these to my son every birthday and Christmas,5.0,These are super delicious!!! Great gift
Price vs taste,3.0,"They were good, don't get me wrong but at $3.00 a biscuit just because they say Gourmet and have some chocolate on them, well its just not worth the price. Won't buy again."
Delicious.,5.0,"Delicious, fresh and on-time delivery."

Boxed nicely and interesting chocolate dips,3.0,Sent these to someone recovering from a knee operation. She said nicely boxed and presented. Chocolate dips were very flavorful. The cookie was ok on the small size. Without the chocolate covering these would be just ok!!!
Not Fresh,1.0,The recipient of the biscotti said it was tasteless. :(
Artistically Crafted with Taste to Match,5.0,"I was recently gifted a box of Barnett's Hazlenut Cream Filled Wafer Cookies and am not only pleased with the careful way in which the product was packaged, but the care and skill that went into every light, airy, crispy bite. Coupled with an iced coffee or hot tea, this cookie will soon become your favorite. Make sure to buy an extra box for yourself to share during the upcoming holidays, or just to brighten the spirit of friends, family or neighbors!"
Delicious But Broken,3.0,"This was an anniversary gift. They said they were delicious, but HALF of the biscotti arrived broken. Super disappointed about that. One or two I could live with, but half? No. No one wants to recieve a broken gift. Barnetts, you need to improve wrapping and stability of biscotii to prevent this type of damage."
Totally Unacceptable Delivery Method,3.0,"The Biscotti are great, we know that from that past, however two gift orders of them were poorly bagged and left on the ground, near the residences, where animals destroyed them. Unless your delivery location is protected, don't order these."
Don’t purchase,1.0,This was ordered as a birthday gift. I was so embarrassed when I was told they were stale and the worse tasting biscotti ever. They had to throw away. I will never order food from Amazon again.
Should be more careful protecting biscottis,3.0,Biscottis were not carefully protected during shipment ... there were a few that were cracked and tray was filled with cookie crumbs from being thrown around ... this was a gift so I feel embarrassed
Chocolate toppings arrived slightly melted & mushed,3.0,"Flavor and ""Box"" presentation was nice. Chocolate toppings were slightly melted"
Looked better in picture than in reality!,3.0,"Product was not like picture. Not much chocolate on each item. Was a gift to family, but they were not please with product."
Very well received,5.0,Gifted this to a very happy recipient who has mentioned several times how much she enjoyed these biscotti. They are softer than the usual biscotti so able to enjoy without dunking as well.
Broken but delicious.,3.0,"The majority of the biscotti were broken into two or more pieces. But, they did have a great taste."
Super gift,5.0,The Biscotti were a gift for my Son-in-Law’s birthday and he absolutely loved them. He lives in Michigan and I live in England and he sent me an email to thank me and said they were so delicious they didn’t last long. He is the only one who could eat them as my daughter can’t have Gluten so I expect he’s probably put on a couple of pounds! LOL 😂 Wish I could have tasted them too!
Not impressed,2.0,"These were a Christmas gift from son. Can’t decide if stale on arrival because of packing or just an unimpressive recipe. A few were crumbled. Not what I would describe as a biscotti. More like a shortbread but not a rich flavor. Very bland. I will make sure to inform our son before next holiday but didn’t want to burst his bubble, because we appreciate his thoughtfulness."
"Melted, but very tasty.",3.0,"Some of the chocolates were melted, and messy. The flavors were delicious!"
Good but in pieces on delivery.,3.0,Biscuits were broken on arrival. They were a gift. Left a less than desirable impression.
A gift,3.0,Very attractive looking
Gift,5.0,"I received this as a gift from my daughter, loved it!! No picture, I ate them."
Excellent,5.0,Purchased for my daughter’s birthday & she LOVED them
Great with coffee in the morning.,5.0,I sent this as a gift and they loved it.
Pretty but stale,3.0,Beautiful packaging. Fast delivery. But stale. Gift reflects on me as the giver. Embarrassed and disappointed to gift this item.
Great gift,5.0,I gave this as a gift to my brother for his birthday and he and his grandkids loved the biscottis.
You do not get what they are showing in this picture. Different cookies; broken pieces; cheap box,1.0,You do not get what they are showing in this picture. Different cookies; broken pieces; cheap box
Disappointed,1.0,I received this as a gift and amazed they charged $40 for these. The different biscotti were so bland it was difficult to tell them apart. Even the bread was poorly textured and flavorless. The maker should try Nonni's to see what a real biscotti is like.
So delicious!!!,5.0,Perfect as a gift!!! Love them!!
Presentation 100% / Stale :(,3.0,"Good - the packaging. Beautifully bowed, cellophane wrapped inside, several varieties.
Bad - completely dried out and stale with not much taste. On the soft side vs hard traditional biscotti - more like a cookie.

My granddaughters (3 and 1) loved them. Adults did not."
A great change up gift from flowers!!,4.0,"I ordered this for a gift for a relative with Italian ties. She like the taste and commented that they were not as hard as traditional biscotti and that she and her husband enjoyed them. My only critique, I was disappointed that they could gift wrap and the confirmation of delivery showed a plain UPS delivery envelope so orientation a little underwhelming. That said, good value for the $$'s spent but would have paid for gift wrap and nicer presentation."
Quality and flavor not good,1.0,Quality and flavor not good
Most were broken or crumbled those that weren’t broken tasted ok,1.0,Did not travel well most were broken or crumbled this was a gift it was very disappointing
Wheat containing product that appears when searching for gluten free biscotti,1.0,This box is not gluten free! It was placed next to the gluten free biscottis under a search for gluten free biscotti. That created the dangerous situation of ordering the bigger box which ended up not being gluten free and potentially poisoning my child with celiac disease with biscottis with wheat!! He gets deathly ill when he eats gluten. He ended up inviting these to his friends when he realized these had wheat. So no treats for his birthday. I’m very upset about this
"UPDATED and Repealed - Don't buy, they ended up in the trash.",4.0,"My original review was a one star and you can read below. However, customer service was spot on. After reading my review the seller reached out and apologized. They did everything they could to win me over. I was extremely skeptical but the replacement box is very good.

I bought these as a gift for my grandmother since she likes biscotti. She claimed they made her mouth numb. 3 other people tried them and said they were terrible over 20 biscotties dumped into the trash. What a waste of money, time and expectation. I would give a zero start if possible."
GIFT,3.0,I ordered this as a gift so I have no clue about the product. Generally nobody complains about a gift.
Great birthday gift,5.0,I sent these to my mom for her birthday and she loved them!
Plastic in biscotti,1.0,"Sent as a birthday gift. When he opened, he said under the corrugated piece was a piece of plastic. He didn’t think much about until his wife bit down in the piece of the white cranberry biscotti this morning and thought she felt a seed and when she pulled it out of her mouth, it was a piece of black plastic. I tried finding how to get them to recall it but can’t find out how to get a refund for it. This was my second time purchasing and thought it was a good birthday gift both times. I hope someone will contact me about it."
Excellent,4.0,Super
Disappointing,2.0,"My mom sent these to us as an Anniversary gift. Box and presentation were very nice and had quite a few not been broken they would have been attractive. Taste was non-existent and they were more crumbled cookie than biscotti. They did give her a refund but that’s not really the point, is it?"
Gift for a friend,5.0,Was gift for a friend. She said that she really enjoyed it
Meh.. flavorless biscuit with chocolate...,2.0,"I got these as a gift from my husband so of course I'm eating them and telling him they are ""good"" ... Unfortunately most came broken and there were crumbs all over all of them. So not pretty at all. And sadly the biscotti has no flavor on its own. And with all of them having the same white or dark chocolate on them and minimal toppings. They all kinda taste the same. .... The best one would have to be the jam ones that actually have another note of flavor... But unlike the advertised picture there were only 2-3 chunks of jam ontop instead of being loaded up. The peppermint one I hardly even tasted the mint until I was done with it... I feel bad my husband paid what he did for this. They are very underwhelming both in appearances and flavor."
Lovely gift,4.0,"My son sent a box of this biscotti to me for Christmas. It arrived in beautiful condition. Looked just like the picture. The biscotti is fresh and delicious. I found it to be a bit softer and crumblier than traditional biscotti so not good for dunking, but I actually think that traditional is too hard to eat without dunking. This is a yummy accompaniment to my morning coffee and a real treat."
Not Biscotti but a cookie,2.0,This is a nice tasting cookie. Not biscotti. Biscotti is meant to be dunked without falling apart. These cookies fall apart when dunked. They are too moist and cakey where biscotti is a very dry biscuit. Disappointed that it was not what I thought it would be. I received it as a gift.
Biscotti’s were all broken,1.0,"We were so happy to receive these and they were sent as a gift from a relative. However, while they are tasty, almost 75% of the biscotti’s arrived broken. This does not make a very nice presentation. Maybe additional packaging in the boxes would be helpful for sure! Disappointing, as I was going to order some for friends but I do not want them to arrive in this condition. Is this normal??"
They don’t taste the way they look,1.0,They were super dry and crumbly half of them were broken there was no taste no flavor difference between any of them even though they had different things on the top it was a gift for Christmas from someone and I would definitely let them know please don’t send these to me again and I will never order them they were bad and they were not real biscotti cookies
Delicious 😋,5.0,"I bought these as an extra treat for my husband’s birthday. He loved them! Some biscottis are too hard , these were perfect and delicious. I would buy these again as a treat or for a gift. Presentation was nice with the birthday box. Would highly recommend these!! He even shared them with me!!"
Great Mother's Day Gift (or anytime gift),5.0,Was looking for a good gift for mom....was thinking Godiva or something like that but nothing would arrive in time. Barnett's biscotti and cookies popped up in my search and they would arrive on the 8th (right before Mom's Day!)...packaging looked very nice so I decided to take a chance (sounded super good and mom likes biscotti enough she makes it although now she's old and that's not so easy). It arrived on the 8th as promised and she hadn't had her tea and whatever for breakfast....called me after she had a few and couldn't be more complementary - is thinking of freezing some to savor them longer - said it was a perfect gift for her! (and she gets to have more on her special day tomorrow before freezing lol)
"Crumbly, not suitable for dipping",1.0,"I received this $45 box of biscotti as a gift. It was packaged well and had a nice presentation inside and out. Unfortunately, they were soft and crumbly. They did not taste like biscotti at all. This product was more like a flavorless shortbread cookie. These did NOT stand up being dunked and were sort of gummy. The cookies were only slightly sweet and I appreciated that in a european way."
I sent it as a gift and my recipient said they tasted good!,5.0,"I didn't see them, but my recipient said they looked yummy!"
Quick & efficient delivery,5.0,A birthday gift for a beloved aunt.
Recipient loved it!!!,5.0,"Sent this as a birthday gift for my brother, a big coffee drinker. He loved it!! Said they are delicious with his coffee!"
Most arrived broken.,2.0,Most arrived broken.
Not individually wrapped?,4.0,"They aren't individually wrapped? Makes them need to be eaten or not enjoyed quickly. I would order again bit not if not wrapped. Customer service contacted me and followed up--very classy.

Very tasty and I ate all within 3 days....oh my"
Delicious,5.0,Tasty gift
Three Stars,3.0,The cookies look great but I haven’t received them yet. I’m excited to try them.
Gift,5.0,Made a nice birthday gift
These are slightly bland cookies and not biscotti,2.0,"We ordered this as a gift but when it arrived we had second thoughts. The box had greasy finger prints on it and the ribbon was not on the box. That was the first sign that there was going to be an issue. We opened the box to find that many had broken and there are tons of crumbs. So with the gift box looking shabby and broken pieces, we tried one and found that while the flavor is ok (though slightly bland), the ""biscotti just crumbles This would not work as biscotti as it needs to be crusted in order to hold together once dipped in a nice hot beverage. Instead, this would fall apart before you even dip it in your cup. I think that we will not be purchasing these expensive cookies again."
Delicious,5.0,It was sent as a gift and they loved it !!
Never again,1.0,Not going to be ever using this as a gift. First year great. This year the delivery failed to meet my expectations. Was unmarked and didnt even have my gift note attached.
Not the gift I wanted to send to Mom,1.0,"This was a birthday gift for my Mom. She is not a big biscotti fan, but has tried a few different types over the years, including homemade by a friend. I wasn't sure about buying this large box because of split reviews here -some good, some very bad -but hoped for a good one. She didn't want to tell me, but finally divulged it was the worst biscotti she ever had. Extremely disappointing for me. While the pieces were decorated beautifully, the biscotti itself fell apart before picking it up and just crumbled. Hardly any taste at all. It wasn't just my mom saying it either. She shared with a few friends and they all agreed. Won't be buying this again."
These are not biscotti !,1.0,"I have eaten biscotti my whole life, either homemade or purchased from an Italian bakery.
These cookies are not biscotti from any permutation of a biscotti that I have had over the years.
These cookies are shaped like biscotti but have the consistency of shortbread (soft).
If you expect to purchase true biscotti, do not buy this product, else you will be very disappointed !"
The best biscotti,5.0,They were delicious
Delicious cookies suitable as gift for friends or family,5.0,"I was luckily to find this wonderful product for gifts. It was not easy for me to find it because I wanted something special to send to my parents in Iraq (even if they do not deserve it!). I spent more than 2 hours in searching about it in Amazon. The shinning chocolate color, taste and the packing make this biscotti really special especially when there is a special occasion like Eid Al-Fitri where all family members (or the loved ones) are gathering together and celebrating these occasions.."
"Delicious, light sugar, fathers day gift",5.0,Lovely gift sent to my dad while I was studying abroad. My whole family indulged in it. Was very fresh & not overly sweet. Loved the many toppings. Will order again when im back to taste for myself. Awesome gift.
Not Biscotti,2.0,"Nice packaging but it’s just not Biscotti. Sadly it looks great but the cookie part is a softer and flavorless as are the toppings. Sadly, we gave them as a gift and some of the guests didn’t know we brought them and we heard them talking about them the same way."
They were stale,1.0,I sent these as a gift to a friend. I asked her to be honest with me about the biscotti because I was going to send to someone else. She told me they arrived stale.
I just think this is a well priced and nice something to send at a tough,4.0,"To be honest, I haven't personally tried these. BUT I've ordered them twice as sympathy gifts - so no real response from the receiving people on their impressions. I just think this is a well priced and nice something to send at a tough time"
Tasted rancid,1.0,"I received the Biscotti Sampler gift box. The expiration date is still 5+ months away so it should be ""fresh."" My first bite into the first piece (almond topping, I believe--from photos on their website) tasted horrible. My husband and I agreed that it had to be rancid. That one bite left such a nasty aftertaste even two hours later! I tried a different biscuit which I would only describe as edible. Like dried up, crumbly cake with imitation chocolate coating. The toppings do not appear to have suffered heat damage or anything--bars LOOK good--but aren't. The cheap vanilla animal cookies I ate to try to get rid of the horrible taste were much better."
Happy,5.0,Nice gift wrap and fast del’y.
Well recieved,4.0,"It was sent as a gift and well appreciated,I myself did not see the package as this was sent across country.
I would not hesitate to send it again,only because of the reaction."
Great taste...,4.0,"It was a gift sent to someone and they loved them, a rough-in texture but great taste, this is what I was told therfore I recommend them as a gift..."
Terrific gift,5.0,"These were a gift. And they were quite a hit. They were very much enjoyed, the flavors were really good. The freshness was fantastic not dried out like some you get in the supermarket. Highly recommend"
Three Stars,3.0,I don't know if they were good or not it was a gift
Yummy,4.0,Gave them to my 92 year-old mother for her birthday biscotti is one of her favorite things and she loved them thanks so much would highly recommend
DON'T CONSIDER FOR A GIFT!!!!!!!! TASTELESS,1.0,"If you are lover of biscotti this will truly disappoint you from texture to taste. Agree with other recent reviews, as to being dry and tasteless. Called Amazon customer service to request refund or exchange. The customer service agent (John) basically said no refund or exchange just because you don't like. Perhaps find a friend that will enjoy, everyone's taste is different. While that is true, you know when something will not be appetizing to others. Received as a gift. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!"
This was a gift so I am not able to confirm taste.,4.0,The product arrived on time. I'm only giving it a 4 stars because it was a gift so I cannot confirm the quality of the biscotti.
this is a review,4.0,"It worked well as a mailed, one-day surprise gift. I got invited to the barbecue.

This is the end of that review."

Item was a gift for Christmas.,4.0,I did not get to eat it so don't know how good it tasted. Didn't get any complaints though.
Plastic in biscotti,4.0,"There was a piece of plastic in one of the biscotti.

Great Mother’s Day gift,5.0,"We sent these to my mother in law for Mother’s Day because she lives 4 hours away. I wasn’t sure what to expect because of the mixed reviews, and we’re in Texas so it’s hot. They were left at her door briefly, but were not melted! She sent me this picture and said they were absolutely delicious! I am very happy with my purchase. She said they were the perfect texture and are perfectly paired with coffee!"
Very Good!,4.0,"These were a gift. The receiver said they were delicious however, two biscotti arrived broken."
Decescription says not cookie like.,2.0,"Received a box for a gift from someone who knows I love biscotti and I won't tell her how disappointed I was with the product, I haven't tasted them all but the couple I had were soft and pretty tasteless."
Very nice,5.0,Really tasty food
Received stale...asked for credit..it was okay but don't see credit yet!,1.0,Product was stale upon receipt...wasn't returnable! I requested credit anyway since product not edible n told credit to be issued. Don't see it yet. Someone advise me.

Not Italian biscotti.,1.0,I received this as a gift. The biscottis are soft and covered in frosting.
Tasteless and messy,2.0,I sent these to someone as a gift they said that they were tasteless messy and difficult to get out of the packaging
The product was so stale could hardly be ate,1.0,I sent this gift to my granddaughter for her 18th birthday and the product was so stale that they could hardly eat them very disappointed and will never order these again I just wasted my money and it was very disappointing I wanted it to be a nice gift
So embarrassed!,1.0,"I gave this product to a loved one. I just received it from someone totally different. I am embarrassed to say this is some of the worst item I have ever tasted. Dry, tasteless and just awful!"
Kind of Stale,2.0,"We got these as a gift, and we will not tell the person who gave the gift to us, but half of the biscotti seemed stale. Some were fresh and tasty, but others seemed like they had been exposed to moisture as they were kind of soggy (and not crunch like normal biscotti). The flavor was pretty good (overall)."
on time,4.0,ok
it arrived soaking wet and ruined. inedible,1.0,I sent this to my friend and now she has no gift from me.
Excellent,4.0,Excellent
Received as a gift - would not buy or gift these.,1.0,"Got them as a gift for Christmas, ate a couple - were not worth the money or the calories."
Biscottis are outstanding and the presentation box makes a great gift for any occassion.,5.0,"The presentation boxes are very classy and the arrangement of biscotti's are amazing. I have sent 5 shipments this past month as gifts and every recipient raved and said that I gave them something that they would also give as gifts.
They taste delicious and the company is terrific to do business with. The shipping is also very quick!
I guarantee the biscotti presentation box makes an excellent present for yourself or someone special."
Disgusting!,1.0,"I will eat anything - and I have a high tolerance for strange, new or unusual things. These ""biscotti"" tasted like ....I don't even know. I tried several different flavors and each one had a horrible flavor /aftertaste. They tasted like...mold, mildew, chemicals and I don't know what else. I literally could not swallow one single, small bite I took and had to spit them out in my hand. They are also like dust when you bite them. I kept choking on the dust for a while afterwards. They expiration date said 5/28/21. Yeah, right."
"Very, very BAD.",1.0,"The biscotti are too crumbly and tasted stale. The frosting tastes as if someone took a scoop of vegetable shortening and added food dye to make it appear as chocolate, but has no flavor to it. They were absolutely awful, and we couldn’t eat them. The presentation is lovely, though—just don’t eat them!!! Yuck."
Nothing like biscotti,1.0,"Very soft, crumbly cookie, with not much taste. They certainly did not look anything like the picture. Were melted, and had hardly any decoration on them. Have tasted much better cookies and would never order these for anyone. I got them as a gift and was very disappointed in their quality and appearance."
Bad biscottis,1.0,I am so upset I just got a call from my friend who received the biscottis and am very disappointed that they had to throw them away. They were horrible tasting and tasted old. They were tried by several people and everyone had the same response. Please if there is a way to make this up to my friend please do. This was a gift for a family who just lost their mother.
Not So Fresh,2.0,Ordered arrived and many of the pieces had a stale taste (Old).. Not recommended.
Very bland,2.0,"The best thing I can say is that they look nice. But they are lacking in any flavor. They appear to be covered in chocolate, but yet have no chocolate taste. The cookie itself is not a biscotti but rather a dense shortbread. Edible, but completely unsatisfying."
Don't buy! Yucky!,1.0,"Received these as a gift. Freshness date is 11/1/2020. These are beautiful! However, they are horrible to eat! The first bite coated my mouth with a film (shortening?) and the taste was nasty, and the nasty taste lingered. We tried a nibble of a few of these--as I said they looked so good--but the verdict was the same for all at our family gathering. We usually buy biscotti by Nonni--those are delicious and more affordable! Will stick with Nonni!"
the product was all rancid and very old. Not eatable.!!!,1.0,I purchased this for a birthday gift to a very close friend. She told me that all the biscottis were old and very rancid. She could not eat them and had to throw them away. I am very embarrassed and disappointed in this company. I would appreciate a refund to my account.
Horrible!,1.0,"We received this box of 24 as a gift. The box was beautiful. Presentation, beautiful. Taste - horrible is too kind a word. We could not tell what flavors were in the box so I randomly picked one. Took a tiny taste (because I didn't know what I was biting into) - to me, it tasted rancid. Very strongly rancid. My husband tried a different flavor. He thought it tasted strongly of soap. I took a tiny bite, it tasted the same as the first piece to me. I couldn't tell you why, but we decided to try one more piece - same thing."
A great gift for any occasion.,5.0,This was sent as a birthday gift & the recipient was very happy with the quality & freshness of the biscotti cookies.
Not impressed,2.0,Did not taste gourmet enough and quiet small.
Stale and Broken,1.0,"These arrived stale, broken and jammed into the bottom of a tight small white bubble envelope, instead of a more protective box! This was a gift for my wife's birthday and it was a disaster. I want my money back!"
Gone before there was time to share.,4.0,"They were a gift and arrived on time and my son ate thermal so quickly his wife didn't get a taste. I am not sure that is a wise move for a newly wed, but he said they were delicious."
Ok,2.0,Was just ok.
Granny perfect gift,5.0,"Bought this for the Great Grandmothers Birthday. My wife asked me why I bought these over getting her some chocolates. Not within 10 minutes did she get a thank you call saying, “ she couldn’t stop eating them and thank god we didn’t get her chocolates because it now upsets her stomach”. I just looked at her and said Mic Drop “Booooom” perfect old lady gift."
daughter sent as a gift,2.0,These looked beautiful but had no taste. Couldn't bring myself to tell daughter who sent it that they were awful....
Not Vegan - No returned allowed = out $40.00,1.0,NOT VEGAN - Bought because they were described as vegan on Amazon. Says no dairy and does say traces of egg but traces does not mean egg added. When my daughter received them it clearly stated eggs as an ingredient. No return policy left me out $40.00 for nothing.
Gift,5.0,This item was a good gift
Delicious and prompt delivery,5.0,Delicious
Disappointed and embarrassed,1.0,"I don't like giving negative reviews, but I ordered these for my Parent's anniversary because they love Biscotti. My Parent's called and thanked me for the cookies and were ready to enjoy however the cookies were very stale and expired. I was quite embarrassed. Paying $40 for treats they (the company) should be sure that the recipient is satisfied."
Arrived in poor condition,2.0,"This was a gift, and product arrived with biscotti in pieces and somewhat melted. Will never order this item again. Beware if you are giving a gift and want to avoid the embarrassment. My friend said that they tasted good although they arrived in poor condition."
Best Biscotti I’ve ever had!!,5.0,"I sent a box to my mother who is in an independent living facility. I haven’t been able to see her in person since the beginning of March. I thought these would be a fun pre-Thanksgiving gift she could share with her friends.

She called me this morning saying she was everyone’s best friend! She brought them to share at breakfast and they were a huge hit!! She couldn’t wait to tell me. “Best biscotti I’ve ever had” she said.

So thank you for making my 95 year old mother’s Day! Not to mention a table full of people at The Veradan in Edmond, Ok!

I’m ordering another few boxes for other family members now!!"
Really Disappointed,1.0,Bought this as a gift because it had so many GREAT reviews. Well I am giving a TRUTHFUL review. Save your money. Buy something else. They came broken. They came a day earlier than ordered. (Wanted them on my moms 94th birthday party). They looked awful. Dry All crumbs. Was so disappointed. I will never go by reviews again.
MADE MY SISTER'S DAY!!!!,5.0,"My sister had surgery and I wanted to send her something to ease her pain and make her happy. I had previously sent her a small box of the biscotti and she loved them. This time, I decided to send her a large box so she could share with her husband and when they arrived, it made her day!!!! She was so happy and the biscotti were so delicious, both my sis and her hubby were able to take a long, yummy break from her the pain of recovery. She immediately sent me a text telling me she had been having a bad day and my gift made her day! Seeing how happy she was, it made my day too. :-)"
Yuk,1.0,"Presentation was nice. But the flavor was disappointing. Didn’t taste like biscotti, and bordering on stale. Would not recommend and would not order again.
*revision: we really tried to like these but ended up throwing over half of them away. Definitely don’t recommend."
Delicious and Beautiful !,5.0,"Great! Sent this to my mom for Mother’s Day. I wanted to try something other than plain cookies or chocolate. My mom loved it and told us it tastes really good.
I was happy that none of them were broken also."
Biscotti Cookies,5.0,Bought these for Mother's Day and my mom couldn't say enough great things about them. She even had to hide them from herself so she wouldn't eat all of them in one sitting. She is going to buy them for a friend's birthday even!
Dried out.,1.0,"Received these as a gift. Looked beautiful. Could'nt even pick one up, it fell apart. They were totally dried out and inedibly stale. Not sure when these cookies were packaged but my guess is sometime in 2018."
Great gift,5.0,"I have this as a gift to my 80 something aunt and she just loved it. I thought they they may be too hard for her but she told me that it made her day with a cup of coffee and she dunked!
She also loved the variety in the box. She shared on with her daughter but I don’t know if she was going to share past that!"
Stale,1.0,I sent these as a condolences gift to a relative. She called me after the funeral to tell me that they were stale. I don't know if thus was a one time event but it was very embarrassing.
Would not purchase again,1.0,"I sent these to my mother for mother's day, she let me know that they were not good, not something she could eat. They were pretty, but that was it. She had 2 friends over who thought the same. She said they were way too sweet and did not like the taste of them at all. She wanted to make sure I did not send them again. I'm very bummed by her response."
Disappointed!!,1.0,"I had ordered this as a birthday surprise for my cousin and was distributed to friends and family. I would have expected this to be really crunchy however this was a total disappointment as these were completely soggy, probably an older batch was shipped ! Also there is no way to contact the vendor (as I shipped it from overseas)"
STALE CHRISTMAS BISCOTTI WITH TASTE AND TEXTURE OF SAWDUST!,1.0,"TASTE AND TEXTURE IS JUST LIKE EATING SAWDUST. Was hoping these would be delicious. A real let-down! When were these made,...at Holloween? These are honestly the worst BISCOTTI and worst item I have ever ordered on Amazon. I wish the CEO of Amazon would taste the BISCOTTI I received. I wouldn't feed these to my dog. They're that awful. I'm a gourmet chef and being totally fare and honest in this review. Don't waste your money or time on this product."
Don’t Buy - Arrived in CRUMBS,1.0,"It arrived with the seal broken, damaged, and in crumbs. It’s inedible."
Horrible taste,1.0,"I had purchased these as a gift and it was very embarrassing when the recipient of the gift told me that
they tasted awful. Just a heads up for anyone wanting to send a food gift. Don't send these."
Completely yummy,5.0,"A family friend was kind enough to send us this product as a Christmas gift. All of us enjoyed these biscotti very much and I decided I would send the same to a friend to celebrate a special event. It was received happily and excitedly, I am happy to report, and I have plans to add this item to my Christmas giving gift list. It's a sure bet to please and to be a lovely presentation."
Don’t buy,1.0,"I am so unhappy with this product. Was a Mother’s Day gift said it would be there may 10 arrived today may 13 and all broken.
Did not present nicely as a gift and as food it should have been time sensitive for freshness. Totally dissatisfied
Update :
So they emailed me thank you for the review?! I guess they really don’t read them or care??
#badbusiness"
This product is awesome!!!,5.0,"I initially had a problem with the product but the owner insured me that she would take care of the problem and she did. Ashley, not only gave me a refund, but also sent me a box of the most delicious and fresh biscotti I have ever tasted. I plan to give the biscotti as holiday gifts this year.

I would send a picture of the beautiful packaging and display, but we ate all the biscotti. I would recommend Barnetts Biscotti Cookies Gift Basket for gifting and for one's self just to enjoy a delicious teat.

Thank you Asley, I appreciate your great customer service! You have made me a customer."
JUNK,1.0,MY BROTHER AND SISTER THEY COULD NOT EAT THEM I SEND ONE TO EACH FOR THERE BIRTHDAY THEY FELT BAD TO TELL ME THEY WERE VERY BAD TILL A WEEK LATER WHEN I WAS GOING ORDER ONE FOR ME..... I TOLD I WAS SORRY.. YOU LIVE AND LEARN TMOE.
Soapy Taste,1.0,This order was bought as an appreciation gift from our company to one of our employees. This was quite embarrassing for the company. He stated that the biscotti tasted very strange. He even tried a couple different flavors and they tasted like someone put dish soap in the recipe.
HORRBILE TASTE AND STALE,1.0,"TODAY, I GOT THIS FOR A GIFT.
VERY STALE AND ALL BROKEN UP INTO PCS.
JUST HORRIBLE.
BOX IN GARBAGE!
I CALLED PERSON WHO SENT IT AS GIFT.
SAID THANK YOU. BUT TOLD HIM TO GET REFUND OF THIS ITEM"
The worst,1.0,"I must’ve gotten an old box or bad batch because these were inedible, tasteless, horrible and went in the garbage. I’m an avid baker for many years and these were unacceptable."
False advertising!!,1.0,"False advertising!! The product is NOT vegetarian, nor does it contain “traces of egg” it contains actual eggs in the ingredients. Cannot claim the product to be vegetarian or kosher."
was a welcome gift,5.0,"gave to my mother for mothers day, arrived fresh and all cookies whole. she loved the different toppings. will order again for myself when she comes to visit."
You won't be disappointed. Worth every penny.,5.0,"I have purchased Barnett's Sweet Creations numerous times but this is my first review. First of all, the packaging is beautiful. I couldn't wait to open it. When I first opened the box, the aroma delightfully took over the room. Then was revealed the artistically prepared assortment of chocolate treats. It seems to me as though great care was taken to make each one. Then it became like binge watching a TV series you been waiting for. You want to have them all but then they will be gone. So I was patient, and took my time. I can say from the start of the order to the last crumb, it was a delightful experience. I highly recommend Barnett's Sweet Creations and will definitely be purchasing them again."
Arrived broken and melted,1.0,This was a birthday gift and they arrived broken and melted what a waste of money!
Sweet tooth this will be perfect,4.0,Delicious gift perfect amount for someone with a sweet tooth
Disappointed,1.0,I searched gluten free and this is what came up only one person out of 5 can eat as they are gluten free I was not happy
Product issues,1.0,"The Biscotti box was gifted to us. When we opened the box, biscotti looked very attractive and tempting. but when we tried one, it had a terrible smell of petroleum. Then we noticed, all of them had the same awful chemical smell. The manufacturer needs to do some serious quality control on the equipment, material and the ingredients going into this product. In its current state, the product is not usable."
Don’t purchase! Tasteless STALE,1.0,"Biscottis ARE tasteless&stale!! Boxing was pretty& such a shame,Zero flavor!! Very expensive$$ & please forward to mfg as they Need to know now,Amazon does not want sooo many awful reviews!"
Note missing...,1.0,Note missing...Note was not included in the package. This was a gift and the most important part was the note... and there wasn't any!
Wouldn’t buy again; many broken,2.0,"The product was very disappointing. The packaging was attractive but many of the biscotti were broken. As a result, the crumbs from each covered others and looked unappealing.

The taste was very average to below average."
"Soap Biscottis? Stale? Dunno....but buyer beware, these are NASTY",1.0,"Ok, this was a gift for someone in the family and holy moley, these are awful! Left the funkiest ‘film’ in our mouths and chemically aftertaste that is very persistent. Three of us tried them, and nope...all had the same experience. One reviewer said “soap”....that’s pretty accurate. SOO nasty.... Maybe we got a bad batch, or maybe this is how they taste, but I would never order these myself to find out."
Empty box delivered,1.0,Sent an extra large box of biscotti cookies to my niece and her husband as an anniversary gift. She opened the box and it was EMPTY.
stale biscotti. tasteless mostly air covered with thin layer of chocolate.,1.0,"stale and messy. ""chocolate"" was wet and runny. Not gourmet, not good. would not buy again. wish I could return these for a refund."
beautiful and delicious,5.0,"I received this beautiful and delicious box of biscotti as a gift, which made my day. unfortunately Amazon did not include a gift card so I had no idea who sent them. I reached out to Barnetts Sweet Creations and they quickly responded. I will definitely keep these in mind as a gift I would send. The variety are all appealing, hard to decide which to eat since they are all appealing."
"They are only 4"" long and have no flavor compared to Nonni's.and way overpriced.",1.0,"Smaller than Nonni's by an inch, not very tasteful, just decorated nice, will not buy again from here, way overpriced"
Perfection,5.0,"We received this as a Christmas gift from a very dear friend. We have always been coffee drinkers and enjoy a delicious cup. We had not had biscotti with our coffee for some time, so many are dry, stale or without flavor. It is unbelievable the freshness, flavor and quality of this product, we are sold and Barnett's will be our new obsession. We will be sending this product for gifts and treats to friends, family and ourselves from now on."
"Horrible, stale, low quality",1.0,"So embarrassed that I gave these as a gift.
Threw out the ones I purchased for myself too.

Stale!,1.0,"Product was a Mother’s Day gift purchase. My Mom loves coffee, especially with biscotti. She tried 1 of each flavor and said that the product was very stale. Across the board, the gift was not enjoyable."
Not a bakery quality,1.0,Damaged not great
Too expensive !,5.0,Too sweet!
Arrived open and broken,1.0,Arrived open and broken. Nasty. And NONREFUNDABLE!!
Disappointed and embarrassed by your stale cookies,1.0,The cookies were stale. It was a gift . Very disappointed. A fresh assortment should be sent by your company to Ed Riccib
Looks are deceiving...,1.0,These arrived and look beautiful but taste like sawdust with a sweet top. Would not give as a gift.
Valentine’s?,2.0,"Why is a Valentine’s Day package recommended for mother’s day? I should have read more closely I suppose, but I just assumed they would know what occasion by proximity on the calendar. Not the best time for a warm weather delivery either."
"Sugar Cookies, Not Biscotti",1.0,This is not biscotti. It’s more like sugar cookies. Very disappointing. And the price is absolutely outrageous. Borderline consumer fraud.
Four Stars,4.0,They were a gift for my mother she loved them
horrible gift,1.0,This was absolutely horrible. received as a gift. tasted stale among other things
Biscottis,5.0,Arrived at scheduled date and was in perfect condition and tadtevgreat

Old - no good!,1.0,Product was no good! Couldn’t dip in coffee - fell apart- tastes old!
Wonderful,5.0,Great quality
Tasted and smelled like Puke!,1.0,My brother sent these to my parents. I have NEVER in my life tasted anything so bad. Tasted like Puke! Smell was really bad. I am trying to tell my parents to tell my brother they have to go back. I only took a bite of 2 of them. After the first one I spit out I figured let me try another. Just as bad. I tried to cut one and it was like dust after. Really bad.
Inedible stale cookies,1.0,Bought them as a gift but they arrived spoiled. It sucks to get a call from the person you bought it for as a gift hearing they couldn’t even alert them... do not buy
Redemption,5.0,Was just informed that the recipient of the order received another package with some very tasty and fresh biscotti. Thank you for being customer focused and addressing the issue.
Disappointed,1.0,"This is not biscotti, it tasted like shortbread and was completely melted when it arrived. Very disappointed since it was a gift"
Do not buy. Do not send.,1.0,"I meant to send this item as a gift, but I accidentally sent it to myself. I'm glad I did. I found out the biscotti are very dry, very brittle, and nearly tasteless. As others have said, some of them were also broken upon arrival. Perhaps a function of their being so dry and brittle upon shipping. Therefore, do not buy these cookies for yourself, and certainly do not buy them as a gift for others. My strong recommendation to you."
Delicious!,5.0,This was a gift to my long time friend! He couldn't wait to eat these! Even his dad who avoids sweet treats tried a few and loved them!
Lindo,5.0,Le agradó a la persona que lo recibió
Great gift,5.0,These were a gift for my mom. They arrived beautifully packaged and she raves about the taste.
Sadly this was a Mother Day Gift that fell short of edible.,2.0,Sadly this was a Mother Day Gift that fell short of edible. The baked goods were hard as nails. The packaging was beautifully done in contrast. So it is with a degree of sympathy for the seller and bakery that these were recycled after several attempts at consuming the product. This may be an isolated occurrence.
You can get sick tastes like soap,1.0,"There is a serious problem, 3 people tasted them and wo asking each other all said they tasted like soap and had a long aftertaste. Called company because scary and there is a problem, all they want to do is send a new package. Seriously wasn’t the point, someone will get sick"

Surprise,5.0,"Next morning delivery system is wonderful. I used this service for my grand son birthday. It's a surprise for him. Of course, the cookies were very good. He said they were very delicious, and very good for birthday party with his friends. I like this service and the cookies."
GREAT FLAVORS AND FRESH,5.0,"I sent these to a friend after her hand surgery. She called me immediately when they were received (after she and her husband ate one each). She said they were delicious and she’s promised to save me one. She talked about the great variety; I plan to order a box for our family. I made a good choice in my gift selection, you will also."
Like biting into a bar of soap,1.0,"White chocolate biscotti tasted like soap and left a weird film in my mouth. The soapy flavor lingered. So half the biscotti were inedible, and had to go straight to the trash."
AWFUL!,1.0,Sent this as a gift only to be embarrassed by being told it was old and stale. The biscotti was within the expiration date. This item doesn't even deserve 1 star.
Beautiful & Delicious Gift,5.0,"Parents loved it. Very fresh, nicely decorated and flavorful. Sent as Valentine's Day gift. Would send again as a gift to someone."
Bad,1.0,This product seemed old. The cookies were dry and crumbled. Not satisfied at all. Would return but can’t. Will not buy again

Tasty,5.0,Giftable
Great birthday gift! Who doesn't like delicious biscotti?,5.0,I ordered biscotti as a birthday gift so it has taken some time to review this product as the she went on vacation (me not knowing). When she arrived home it was a nice surprise. I think other family members enjoyed it too! They loved the biscotti! I am a happy customer. Thank you for being so prompt in getting the order out so quickly. It did arrive on her birthday.💕
Great taste,5.0,Bought this for my sister's birthday. She loves biscotti. She said they are wonderful
Dont order when its warm,1.0,It was sent as a birthday gift and the chocolate was melted. They said they would enjoy them but not the surprise birthday gift I wanted to send. Maybe I missed it but it should be put in the description not to order during the warmer months. Probably no chance of getting any refund at this point.
Fresh and Delicious!,5.0,"Great Gift! Was looking for An Easter surprise out of the norm, sent to 3 different family members All said cookies had a nice presentation, fresh and delicious!!!"
Tastes Even Better than they looks!,5.0,"They looked spectacular, nicely arranged in the box, but I wasn't sure if they would taste as good as they looked. I took a chance and sent this as a gift to my sister-in-law for her birthday. Well she loved them. We Italians love our Biscotti and these definitely did not disappoint. I'm always looking for something different to give and I would recommend them highly, and intend to buy them again."
The Freshness,5.0,"I purchased this item as a birthday gift to my uncle. He loved them and was so impressed by the freshness and flavors he asked where can he buy them, he wants more. Little does he know, I will be ordering two more to add to his Christmas gift. Thank you!"

Their reactions were, OH GREAT, WE LOVE IT.

Since I am not the recepiant I cannot make a comment"
do't gift this product,1.0,sent this as a gift and it arrived crumbled and dry so much that the gift receiver mentioned how por the condition was. It was not fresh at all. No recourse for a refund either. Stay away from this product.
Wow - don’t spend the money.,1.0,Presentation gets a 9 out of 10. Taste gets a 1 out of 10. It tasted very stale.
Gift was much appreciated,5.0,Recipient loved them!
Beautiful presentation,5.0,"It was a get well gift. She indicated the packaging was stunning. Biscotti were fresh and delicious. Each one was unique. No issues, no room for improvement. A#1.

Card was written as asked... will use your company again in a heartbeat."
Perfect Gift,5.0,I had this product delivered to my daughter for her birthday. Unfortunately I didn’t get to see it but she was very happy with it. Her 3 children watched her open the gift and she said their eyes almost popped out of their heads! Everyone enjoyed it very much. I would say it was the perfect gift!
Great Corporate OR Family Gift,5.0,"I have bought these for personal and corporate gifts with wonderful success! While I personally have not had an opportunity to taste them, everyone who received raved about them and in turn sent some as gifts. I think that is the ultimate compliment - when a gift to them turns into a gift to others. I will continue to use these biscotti for Mother's Day, birthday and corporate giving!!"
STALE,1.0,Sent my Mom these cookies for her Birthday ..She said they looked good ..but were stale and the frosting was pasty. Very disappointing
Pretty. Bad. Rating = (-) 11 Stars,1.0,"Pretty bad.
Stale, virtually flavorless, bearing absolutely zero resemblance to biscotti. In fact, the icing tasted like the same icing you'd find on knockoff, second quarter 2014 dollar store cookies. BTW - anyone writing a positive review about these is a shill, fake reviewer, & full of crap. They are purchased primarily to be sent as gifts by low budget office supply companies. We can't even comprehend what else, or what drug effects you'd have to be under, to lie about the quality of these things. Each and every ingredient is stale and flavorless. The texture is like a stack of off-brand graham crackers. Anyone here somehow mistaking graham crackers for biscotti! Yeah, didn't think so. Contemplating using them as a gift to clients? You'll kill any goodwill dead if they sample these. Offensive & poorly made by uncaring factory workers using a recipe created by someone who's never seen, eaten, or smelled an actual biscotti. If you get these as a gift from.a vendor or contractor, deep six the creeps, because they either hate and disprespect you & your business or they don't give a crap if they offend you because you've already overpaid them."
Saben ricos!,5.0,Es ideal para regalar en ocasiones especiales.
"Extremely crumbly, virtually inedible cookie. Nice box.",1.0,"The thing I disliked most was the fact I disappointed my Italian Grandma. Its Supposed to be a bit crunchy, but - Long warehousing?? - I have no idea what else could explain this dry, desiccated, sapless cookie, that pulverized to crumbs when I tried to bite it. embarrassing. The box was nice, everybody agreed. Never left a review before."
Great gift,5.0,I sent these as a gift. They loved it and said they were delicious...
Mother in Law loved them,4.0,"My mother in law loved them but somehow the card said ""Happy Mothers Day"" aiai Wilford and Lisa, which is not our names. At least it made her laugh"
they were like a soft cookie in the middle,2.0,"Other than the coating they had no flavor what-so-ever. And, they were like a soft cookie in the middle, not crisp like expected. Also, they should have been individually wrapped. I will not purchasing these again."
'Lovely' Biscotti Cookies!,5.0,"This was a ""Thank You"" gift for my 85 year young Aunt. She had had a rough year with breaking her hip, then 3 months later after being home only one night from the hospital, she fell and broke her shoulder. She managed to get healthy enough to host her Christmas Eve dinner.
I just wanted to thank her for being such a loving and caring Aunt in everything she does for my family.
She absolutely loved these Biscotti Cookies! She raved about them! I was happy to hear how much she enjoyed them! She loved the packaging, presentation and taste of these cookies!!! It was a ray of sunshine on a cloudy year she's had!"
This gift was well received...,5.0,I sent this as a gift to a person who had surgery - they really loved it - great with a cup of coffee/tea!

Great Gift!,5.0,"This was given as a thank you gift. They looked absolutely delicious and knowing how my brother & his wife loved biscottis, we decided it was the perfect gift. They enjoyed it with a nice cup of coffee. (Just wished that the headline didn't say ""Father's Day Cookies"" as it made me second guess sending it as a thank you gift)."
They are absolutely amazing! I consider myself a gourmet pastry connoisseur,5.0,"I would give these 6 stars if I could! They are absolutely amazing! I consider myself a gourmet pastry connoisseur, and am hard to please, but these are absolutely the best treat for the Holidays! They always make my Hanukkah more sweet. Light yet with substance, and always very fresh upon arrival. My only problem is, I can't make them last. I grab two to have with my tea and savor with a good book in my lap, and always have to go back to the kitchen for the 3rd (or 4th). If one is to have a vice, this is the most delicious one to indulge in! And, amazingly, they are healthy and light, so no need for guilt trip. My recommendation - get 2 boxes! And send one to friend for beautiful surprise gift. They more than live up to their status as ""gourmet""; I can testify to that."

These are incredible - the flavors are rich, the crispness perfect and the presentation is lovely! The bridge club ladies adored them and wanted to know where to buy these. My mother always serves many wonderful treats for the bridge club - so when these disappeared first I knew they had to be great."

Rock hard Biscotti!!,1.0,"My daughter gave me this fancy gift box of Biscotti. To me they were just awful. I have never liked Biscotti, since they are way too hard for my taste, but, with the chocolate topping and sprinkles, I thought they might be different, bhey were just awful. The worse part was I had to tell her that I didn't like them so that she would never send them to me again. I just wish she could get her money back, and I will be glad to send back the remaining ones. I kept trying to find anything good about them so I tested one of each kind. They were all BAD!!"

Best on the market,5.0,These are the best biscotti available and they taste amazing and very fresh and beautifully presented!
Five Stars,5.0,Delicious and nice presentation. Will definitely buy again for a gift
A great biscotti for anybody,5.0,So many different flavors and toppings. Comes with 12 biscuits that taste amazing and pair perfectly with milk. They are so full of flavor and my favorite was the cranberry topped biscotti. Would make a wonderful gift for anybody who loves cookies or chocolates
Better than a card,5.0,"This is so much better than sending a birthday card. This is an all in one gift to have on hand to give to someone in person. Or better yet, order and have it arrive at their home.

It has been very difficult for me to get into a store and pick out cards as of late. I have been sending small gifts rather than cards to my family and friends on special occasions. These have been so greatly appreciated while everybody has been away from each other during the past year.
These biscotti are a perfect birthday gift for anyone who loves sweets, coffee, or wine, or baked goods. When you open the box you can smell the chocolate right away. They are definitely gourmet. The recipient of this is really going to feel appreciated.
And I think something like this is just far more enjoyable than a card. And with the price of stationary and postage it really isn’t that much more expensive."
Bland Taste,4.0,"Product arrived fresh but with minor signs of exposure to high temps (melted chocolate topping on two pieces). I’d say they are less biscotti and more like cookie slices dressed like well..cookies. Just my opinion. I felt many tasted similar despite visually dissimilar toppings. Had hoped for more variety in flavors and stronger flavors at that. Packaging is well-done, though someone can always screw up even the best packing during delivery and handling."
Dry and overpriced,1.0,"Besides the toppings, these biscuits were flavorless. The picture let me to believe they were actual finger cakes but they are just dry coffee biscuits. The actual biscuit has no flavor and the quality of the toppings do not reflect the price tag. Definitely best eaten with tea or coffee, I would not recommend eating without a drink!"
So delicious!!!,5.0,"Every once in a while you just want to be a little fancy. And man, do these biscotti do the trick! I usually have regular biscotti with my morning coffee, but saw these and couldn't pass them up. Granny Bella's does not disappoint! They come beautifully packaged in a 12 pack variety box. The flavors are phenomenal - crisp, rich with a smooth chocolate dip on them. The caramel chip ones may be my favorite, though it truly is hard to pick!"
"Okay, but not great.",2.0,"They were a little pricey but not bad. They arrived in time and they were NOT broken packed in nice packaging. Too me, they did not have the texture of biscotti and they did not seen to have much flavor.

In the final analisys, I would not purchase them again."
Delicious and long lasting,5.0,"The flavor on these are really, really delicious! They pair perfectly with my morning coffee or the boys' milk at night after dinner. They seem to last forever too. Almost a month and they aren't stale yet. They would make an excellent gift to someone...if they legit made it out of my house lol"
Great gift..,5.0,These biscotti's are very good and also kosher...They make a lovely gift most people would like to have....its a bit pricey but who cares...its for you and you will like them very much and they are decorated to be festive.
Best cookie EVER! I recommend these cookies!!,5.0,"The first box I received was below standards. The company immediately contacted me about the issues. To my surprise they immediately sent me out a replacement box and issued a refund upon seeing the condition of the cookies. I would highly recommend the product and company, Barnett, to anyone."
These are delicious,5.0,Not only are these delicious they make a great gift have sent them to my 93 year old mother and she loves them
Not what I aspected for a biscuits,4.0,"The box is very nice, when open is beautiful and the smell makes you run for a cup of coffee. But the deception comes at the first bite. Is not crispy at all. It reminds more as a cookie then a biscuit. Maybe I was hoping too much from it."
Delicious and fresh! Would buy again!!,5.0,"I purchased for my in laws who live in another state. We actually visited them shortly after, so I was able to taste the biscotti... DELICIOUS, fresh, nice variety. My Italian mother in law loved them! I would purchase again and again!!!"
Delicious,5.0,"I supposed to receive this delicious product on the 16 but arrive early. I opened to see the quality and is all gone lol. Fresh, delicious and very good quality. Now I have to order more. This one was for the holiday but obviously didn’t make it. I recommend this product."
Absolutely delicious!,5.0,"These biscottis are absolutely decadent both in appearance and taste. They were fresh and had a very good, almost a subtle vanilla flavor.

I definitely recommend this product."
Delicious- delicate delivery please,4.0,"We were sent these as a gift and we loved them. Delicious to look at and of course eat!

sent as a gift to my daughter.,5.0,Barnett's Biscotti Cookies are so special. I can't even describe the taste. Almost too good to give away as a gift. My box is empty now. Gonna order another today.

Such a great purchase! Thank you!"
