Was a very nice gift.,5.0,Was a very nice gift for our friend. He totally enjoyed it.
Great value,5.0,Great gift and flavor
Very tasty and cute chocolates,5.0,"I was surprised by these chocolates, because they are different than a lot of others I‚Äôve tried. The chocolate is rich in the centers are all very good even the ones I wouldn‚Äôt normally care for our good. The flavors are not overwhelming also, there are a lot of mostly chocolate pieces that are either ganache or cream as well as some cordial and fruit centers. There are also quite a few with different forms of nut inside each piece is in a very cute shape, not just round or square. There are hearts and stars and a lot of other intricate designs."
Pricey,4.0,It‚Äôs too expensive for such a small box. I expected it to be a bit bigger for the price.
Yummy,5.0,I bought this as a gift for a sick friend. She loved it and made me try one. It was great. It is a nice size gift and quite delicious.
Not the same,2.0,"I love Godiva chocolates, but they did not send what they pictured was in the box. Only two milk choc, the rest dark. Won‚Äôt order from them again. I order the whole box just to get the white chocolate raspberry and it was not in it."
Candy,4.0,Delicious
5 star product but not 36 pieces,4.0,This product did not include 36's pieces. It was 1 row short.
"Still Good, But...",4.0,"Godiva is abandoning retail outlets to distribute online and through chain stores.

The quality is still good, but not quite what it once was."
Missing advertised chocolates,1.0,"This set did not contain the white chocolate raspberry star, which is advertised on the back of the product as being included. Very disappointed as that is my favorite one. There are also a lot of duplicates (8x2), not including chocolates that are meant to come with multiple types. There are way less fruit flavors than I expected - the only ones included in this 36 count set are the cherry cordial and an orange ganache, which was as well extremely disappointing. I used to really like this brand, but you can tell they are cheaping out on ingredients. As much as I love those fruit chocolates I'm not risking purchasing another box just to find out it's all ganaches and caramels again. Also, the white chocolate ganaches are bad - extremely bizarre texture. Godiva has changed, unfortunately."
Beautiful assortment!,5.0,There were so many different flavors! You‚Äôll definitely find one you love. I got this as a Valentines Day gift and it was the best idea ever. Beware if you can‚Äôt eat a lot of sweets maybe get a smaller pack.
Love this Godiva Assortment,5.0,Fun we can still get Godiva through Amazon since the retail stores are gone in my area. Great fun assortment box
High quality chocolate!,5.0,Purchased it as a gift for my daughter. They are a little pricey but she loved them. She had a big smile. They are velvety smooth and very delicious. Great quality and packaging was fancy.
Can‚Äôt Go Wrong with Godiva,5.0,Beautifully packaged. Small size makes these boxes of chocolates perfect as favors or to tuck in with other gifts.
CAME FRESH!,5.0,"I was hesitant to buy because I see a lot of people who say the chocolate was old, melted, chalky, etc. But my box came perfectly packaged and sealed. I originally bought them as a gift for somebody but I didn't get them in time (due to my own procrastination). So, I kept them for myself. I am on a diet, so I allotted myself one chocolate per day. They were so good, I almost didn't make it. We have a Godiva shop here where I live. Unfortunately they closed due to COVID, but they were just as fresh as when you buy them in the shop!"
Came in fresh and complete,5.0,This product is a bit iffy depending on the time of year that it comes. This box was perfect and all the chocolates fresh and delicious. I recommend this seller.
Amazon is the Best,5.0,"As usual,Amazon came through for Valentine‚Äôs Day! After Fooling with Godiva for days on availability, price, shipping, peace of mind and meeting a deadline, Amazon came through on my doorstep! Prriod"
Is getting expensive,5.0,I used the product for a gift but the person who I give the chocolates said it was not fresh I reply with chocolates dont age.
"Wonderful, but WAY too expensive.",5.0,"I love this chocolate. But, it is very overpriced. It was packaged extremely well."
Decent chocolate but overpriced,3.0,"Overall these chocolates are decent, they taste flavorful and look delicate, the packaging looks fancy and it‚Äôs a great gift to bring for a party. However, comparing to other chocolates, this is a bit overpriced. There are not many pieces and they don‚Äôt taste as amazing as other chocolates with similar price range."
Major is dark chocolate,1.0,"I do not like dark chocolate at all. I was looking forward to the milk and the white chocolates and giving my husband the dark chocolates. This is not a variety at all. Mostly dark, a few milk and no whites. I was really looking forward to the white starfish chocolate. If you love dark chocolate this box is for you. $22 for a few milk chocolates and the rest all darks wasn't worth it for me."
presentation & taste,5.0,"I liked the product, it makes lovely little gifts"
That it is very good,5.0,I like the taste of it smooth and creamy
Very good!,5.0,Delicious!
Great,5.0,It's Godiva. What's not to like?
Delicious,5.0,"One if the best xmas gifts I gave this year, and got to help eat! The chocolates were fresh and fantastic."
This Godiva assortment was less than I expect from the Godiva brand and price.,3.0,Did not include fruit creme chocolates. These chocolates seem to be lesser in quality than a few years ago. I will probably not buy again. Definately not this assortment.
Refridgerate,5.0,Very rich flavors best ever
Disappointed,3.0,I was sending this as a gift and it says its 19 pieces of chocolate but there was only 16 . Not as advertised beware if your going to buy as a gift.

A delicious gift for friends with a sweet tooth.,5.0,"Fresh, delicious box of candy I was told by recipient. Loved the candy."
Perfect delivery manners,5.0,"Godiva was sent as a ""sorry I can't be there for Thanksgiving gift."" Initial delivery was promised for Tuesday Nov 24, which was okay. They arrived Friday! Recipient was at work during delivery time so the Prime delivery guy put it behind her screen with the plain back of the package facing out. Whew. :) Also... she loves the chocolate! Exactly as pictured, no melting or any other possible disaster."

"Chocolate melted, not a great gift",2.0,"I should have known better than to order chocolate for delivery in Florida. This was also a birthday gift. When the recipients opened it I was there, it was embarrassing to say the least. Not happy for the price it cost. Should have just stop by Walmart instead."
"On time, perfect!",5.0,Perfect product for far away family.
An amazing gift to receive,5.0,A surprise thank you gift
Just chocolate,2.0,I am very surprised theses are just chocolate they all taste basically the same to me. Very expensive and very disappointed. They were fresh and shipped in a refrigerated container. My Lindt truffles were very much cheaper and very much more flavorable for a 1/4 the cost. I would never buy or gift these again.
The Diva gets Godiva for Breakfast!,5.0,Great gift! Arrived late at night and was brought in for breakfast! Didn‚Äôt freeze and provided a welcome treat for my 15 year old granddaughter who refused to share with rest of the family! LOL

Beautiful presetation,5.0,It was a present and you can never go wrong with Godiva.
Always the best in chocolates.,5.0,Excellent candies as always from this company. A bit expensive but worth the money.
Tiny Box,3.0,"I guess I should have looked at the dimensions, but the Box is very small. For almost $40 bucks you think you would get a decent sized assortment, but no dice."

Bad chocolate,1.0,Do not buy bad chocolate I purchased this product for Valentine‚Äôs Day gift was extremely disappointing not only was the box extremely small for 30 dollars but when my wife opened all the chocolate was bad it looked as it had been melted it was white and nasty my wife was extremely disappointed with Amazon these items are non returnable so it‚Äôs a waste of money do not buy
Inedible,1.0,"This product arrived damaged. Melted, chalky and some debris mixed with chocolates. Now I am told that it is unreturnable. That is a joke, should have just torn $50.00 up. I will never buy from Godiva again."
Horrible experience with seller,1.0,Chocolate was melted. Pretty expensive for inedible food.
Melted tasteless,1.0,Most candies were melted and identifiable and tasteless. Won‚Äôt order again because it was bad it should have been cold when delivered.
Not Too Happy,1.0,"Pretty damn disappointed that my mom received this in the mail, from me today."
No gift options?,1.0,Need gift options so receiver can no who it is for
amazon made good on this failure,1.0,"Totally no good unacceptable quality; melted, poor visually, garbage."
Godiva reported as great. However no gift card or indication of sender.,5.0,"Gift Godiva, one of three. No gift card as ordered. Awaiting response from other two as I just found out today after 11/29 delivery.

Second of three responded - no card or any other indication of sender."
Melted!,1.0,Arrived with chocolates melted all over inside of box. $34.99 box of melted chocolates.
Love it,5.0,Sooooo good
This Product is Always 100% Awesome & Delicious,5.0,Did not last very long
Not very tasty too sugary and not rich in flavor like other Godiva products,1.0,"Nothing like the Godiva I‚Äôve had in the he past
Definitely a cheaper version"
Arrived very damaged. No refund or return.,1.0,"Uneatable, damaged. Was meant to be a gift."
Melted,1.0,Melted chocolate
Did not follow instructions,1.0,"This item was sent as a gift to my aunt. I had requested a gift card be included with the item, however, when I called my aunt to see how she like the chocolate, she told me because she didn't know who sent it to her, as a safety precaution, she threw it away. Extremely annoyed."
S-l-o-w-l-y shipped from Godiva,2.0,"Completely missed the occasion it was sent for due to extreme slow shipping from Godiva. It took several calls, chats and emails. Godiva Customer service is the worst."
No gift message!,1.0,Good value for the money spent but there was no gift receipt and message to the recipient. What‚Äôs wrong Amazon workers? This happens almost every holidays with gifts.
"It was a gift, but the recipient said they were absolutely delicious!!!",5.0,I gave this as a sympathy gift and my friend and his daughter said they were delicious. Their only complaint is that they had to look on the bottom of the box to see what was inside each candy. That seems silly. There should be something inside to tell you that. But the taste is really what matters and they both loved them.
My Mom‚Äôs Favorite Gift.,5.0,"My 90 year old Mom loves Godiva chocolates so much she hides them from the family! Great quality, value, and packaging"
Great gift to my brother and his family for any occasion.,5.0,Godiva chocolate is a special event in our family.
Probably delicious if they weren‚Äôt all melted upon their arrival.,2.0,Probably delicious if they weren‚Äôt all melted upon their arrival.
Arrived Melted and Inedible,1.0,Unbelievable. This item was a gift. Incredibly embarrassing to receive this picture from my mother on Mother's Day.
Yuck,1.0,"The candy has a really bad stale smell and the dark chocolate has the old dusty layer on top of the chocolate, which is very similar to what really old candy bar looks like. I wanted to return but it‚Äôs saying this is ineligible for return."
Delicious,5.0,"Delicious and delivered in-time. With all the retail stores closing, this might be the only way to buy Godiva"

Always great chocolate,5.0,Came in perfect and not melted or messed up. Godiva is always great tasting.

Great gift item,5.0,Wonderful chocolates.
Can‚Äôt go wrong!,5.0,"These are always a winner, the price point is perfect for sending as a gift and they are exactly as the description says. It is one layer so it is not a lot of candy but the presentation is beautiful"
For GODIVA these taste bland,5.0,I liked how my family ate it in one sitting. It comes with a paper that tells you all about the chocolates that are inside and they also have chocolates on there that are not in the box. It was very confusing to navigate trying to find out which chocolate im eating just by pictures.
Great chocolates,5.0,Perfect gift
